Greetings children, it's me, Captain Disillusion. Too many plot developments have been happening around here lately
it used to be about the work not feelings. Debunking hoaxes and
solving viral-video mysteries no one else could solve
Like this little gem that's been paying regular visits to my inbox for the past five years.
[Jingle music] Host : ""Hi and welcome to this episode of ""Can you imagine""...
A segment in a low-budget promotional webseries from the Rochester Institute of Technology features an unusual piece of
architecture. ""Here we are in the escherian stairwell.
Located in building seven, one of the first structures put up when RIT made the move from downtown Rochester to suburban, Henrietta.
The stairwell designed by Filipino architect Raphael Nelson
Lagonda was built in 1968
and has been wowing RIT students ever since.""  The authenticity of this marvel is then backed up by a bunch of testimonials and
demonstrated in various convincing ways making the impossible seem very clearly possible. But relax
There's nothing paranormal about it. It's just a quirk of design. It's an optical illusion.
Lady : It's just an architectural trick.
It's a totally normal, what are you talking about?
Dude goes up the stairs and comes out from the floor below. Not only is this video fake,
It's not even a video. It's a multi-layered web endeavor that combines narrative filmmaking,
documentary, social media, analytic philosophy and theoretical physics into a creative exploration of how the academic world might respond to the apparent physical
manifestation of a logical contradiction
At least that's what it says in this 81 page master's thesis by Michael Lacanilao, graduate of RIT school of film and animation
sci-fi enthusiast and creator of a modern myth.
It was the dawn of the third year of graduate school
the Escherian stairwell project was a myth given form.
A transmedia art piece wrapped in 52,837 dollars worth
spinning bullshit all alone on the web.
It was a pair of mockumentaries, a network of fake websites and
eventually a massive crowdfunding campaign focused on keeping the myth alive. It failed
I'm sorry to hear that Michael, but trust me
You don't want to take one little project that gave you validation as a young person and milk it for years into a full-time
Crowdfunded career. Before you know it, you're pushing 40 still slathering on stupid silver mak...
I mean spreading rumors about a fake stairwell
You're remarkably skilled as a director and your commentary on your own work is very insightful
""I did not treat the ""Can you imagine"" episode any differently from any of my other films. I wrote a script,
storyboarded the whole thing and we started rehearsing it like a play""
But you're strangely coy when it comes to revealing the details
""The people in the ""Can you imagine"" episode are excellent excellent actors.""
Yeah, but like
Who are they ? Be more specific just say Kevin Schoonover, acclaimed art photographer and proprietor of flying whale studios
Rosie Han, fellow RIT graduate and talented filmmaker in her own right.
I didn't have time to hound down anyone else
But I think after five years they each deserve an individual credit for their excellent performances.
""I don't really research stairwells that often, I guess""
And in a document detailing all the facts behind the project you stopped short of explaining the actual
filmmaking techniques used to achieve the Escherian stairwell effect because you might want to continue the myth
I'm afraid I can't allow that Michael
deconstructing myths is my mission.
Escherian stairwell related keywords in the metadata of this video are spreading through the internet as I speak and a detailed shot-by-shot
Breakdown of the visual effects will commence
now.
Like all convincing illusions the Escherian stairwell video uses a variety of techniques to keep you guessing
Scattered among the testimonials are six scenes where the impossible is actually shown.
The initial demonstration by the host, two demonstrations with Rosie, two background effects with a boy in a red shirt and the final demonstration
with a visitor named Dwayne.
To visualize the tricks, we'll use the latest in machine assisted 3d virtual environment recreation
technology powered by a natural intelligence engine : my brain.
The first scene is a split screen transition enhanced by a subtle camera move
Performing his monologue, the host walks up the first flight of stairs as the tripod mounted camera tilts up slightly.
The tilt stops before he disappears behind the wall,
taking a specific step during a specific line.
Here, action was paused and the actor then walked down to the landing below while the
cinematographer was careful not to disturb the camera position.
Picking up where they left off the host emerges from behind the wall
delivering the same line and the camera tilts down to frame him
We can tell these were real nodal tilts and not just digital
scrolling up and down a wider image because the slight offset of the cameras sensor on the tripod causes tiny parallax on the handrails
But the tilts probably felt too choreographed in the combined split-screen
so a gentle digital camera shake was added to the final shot and, no,
they didn't use twins because twins don't look and sound exactly like each other and everyone would be able to tell!
The next scene is more complicated. It starts on the floor below the main staging area which I guess is why we don't get to see much of it
Rosie walks up the stairs and the camera follows her handheld
Everything is real until she reaches the last step at which point a carefully choreographed
lateral track reveals the host.
But he wasn't really there. The take was over and he had to walk up the stairs the boring way. At the same time Rosie
Went up to the landing above while a fake imposter stand-in Rosie took over her position.
With everyone in place, the action was resumed. The beauty of this framing is that a blank wall leaves you free to align the host from the second shot
with the camera move from the first and makes it easier to blend the two with a soft wipe.
We can still spot the first frame where it appears and the distance between the host and the exit sign shrinks slightly
But it's pretty seamless ! The camera then whip-pans to catch the back of fake Rosie running down the stay and right on cue
real Rosie emerges from above to finish the scene.
Now, strangely, there is another transition hidden in the whip pan
I can't think of any reason for it other than to bridge two different takes containing the best version of both moves
That throws a little doubt on whether this is a double. Maybe it is real Rosie and this is a transition again ?
But if it is it's completely flawless and there would be no need to hide her face here.
Ideally, you should show it. But then ideally you should also use a plus green gel on a tungsten light when combining with a fluorescent.
Mistakes happen. As in the next shot, the host leaves Rosie on the top half landing and walks down.
At the end, he leans over to catch a glimpse of her on the floor below and that's when a huge flashing
rectangle tries to distract us from something. What is it?
There is this odd frozen matte line on the arm, but to really understand what's going on, we'd have to spend hours
painstakingly restoring the shot frame by frame as accurately as possible and no one is crazy enough to...
Okay, here it is. Much more clear.
A separately filmed take of Rosie waving was composited into the background
But unfortunately in the host's take, his arm ended up blocking the exact spot where her head w as supposed to be when the two shots are lined up.
So her element had to be moved over to make her visible
This caused the jump during the transition and a huge misalignment on the overhead light.
It just wouldn't work. In every effects artists life
there comes a moment when he just gives up and flashes a big video artifact
on top of the problem. But next time in lieu of a plain white rectangle,
may I recommend a professional plugin like Red Giant glitch or Video Copilot's twitch ?
Or my own : snitch !
The next two scenes happen subtly in the background of a testimonial.
This was done simply by filming the interview as a static shot,
then filming the two phases of the red shirt kids action,
compositing them all together and adding a bit of artificial camera shake.
And it's a great time for a Hitchcock style director's cameo
Finally the scene with Dwayne involved many people,
but only an instant of trickery.
The host has a brief exchange with him, then sets off down the stairs and it's in
this moment that the magic happens. With a giddy hop the host covers the entire frame,
transitioning the view behind him to a different take of Dwayne by himself during a similar camera pan.
It was needed because almost immediately the rest of the shot cuts to yet another
take in which Dwayne is already in position on the landing below.
The Artificial Dwayne patch keeps it looking like he's upstairs until it's softly wiped away off-screen.
With the handoff completed, we now follow the host all the way down to real Dwayne who greets him with an exotic
double fist bump the likes of which the host has never seen !
Credit where credit's due : the transitions are awesome.
Making them this invisible takes real skill
If you sat me down and warned me that I'm about to see a trick video
I still wouldn't be able to tell how it was done on first watch
But that's not what you did, is it Michael ?
You wanted the world to believe it was real.
You wanted it to go viral, and it did, in a way you might not have been prepared for.
When the video's popularity exploded,
you filed copyright takedown notices against hundreds of reposts,
enforcing some, releasing others, not because you wanted credit or ad revenue but simply as a mechanism for
controlling the spread of the myth to fit with the rest of your production schedule
When curious fans from all over were expected to mob the annual 'Imagine RIT' Festival,
the event the video was designed to promote in the first place,
you posted misleading signs around the campus to prevent too many people from finding your exhibit.
Those who managed to find it were told the truth and
some of them weren't pleased.
Still all attendees were encouraged to keep the secret to perpetuate the deception, and even now, long after you've left college behind
believers continue to make pilgrimages to the school, seeking the stairwell, only to be casually led to the wrong one by worn-out
disinterested faculty members,
""Charles, do you know about the Escherian staircase?"" ""All too much""'
forever burdened by the consequences of your big, clever myth !
[Panting]
I guess I'm being a little unfair.
Putting a negative spin on the events that you yourself described in the thesis.
After all,
you widely-publicized the truth almost immediately and the majority of smart
clear-headed commenters seem to, as you put it, get the joke.
But artificial myths aren't biodegradable.
The video doesn't go away. It continues to drift online as an unlabeled artifact in a world
that's currently having just a little bit of trouble with misinformation.
And to some who find it, it's not a joke or a fun puzzle, but ammunition.
If this is real what else could be real ? If it's fake what else is fake?
12 million people can't be wrong. This reminds me of a cool prop blaster
I once built functional but harmless... well, almost.
Turned out that strong healthy people were completely unaffected by its powerful energy rate
but it tended to cause some weaker, less-advantaged folks significant... discomfort.
Now that's not what I was going for, I didn't have any malicious intent, neither did you.
But now even as you post links under the video to interviews discussing the project,
even in response to your own comments explaining that it's all fiction
believers persist.
A Myth is a story.
Shaped by culture over time. It has a moral, a point it tries to communicate,
The notion that a college somewhere in America is home to a physically impossible stairwell is... just a lie.
I think I understand what you were trying to do. I'm just having a hard time figuring out... why ?
'I remember watching films like Close Encounters or something like 2001.
Watching those films kind of inspired us with awe and a sense of wonder.
How can I create something that would give audiences that type of experience,
that type of experience that I remember, which I haven't felt in a while.
And I don't know what it is : Is it my maturity level ? Is it because movies are getting worse? I don't know.
You know, I, I don't know what the answer is, like, I just saw Star Trek
even Superman, right, Man of Steel. Every time I see a film like that
Every time I see a film like that I just hope that I get swept up again, the way I did when I first saw 2001
And I don't know the answer for why I don't experience that anymore.
All I know is that I don't experience that anymore
Oh...Dude...
That's normal. Those movies affected you so strongly because they were good, but also because you were a kid.
The kids of today are just as impressed by creepy all CGI Ninja Turtles reboots, or whatever it is they watch.
It's their turn to be inspired and your turn to create what inspires them.
Not by reinventing the concept of storytelling, just by telling good stories.
I've been listening to this book on edible.gum
which I think is called 'A hero with a million faces' by Josie camel or something like that.
It's about story structure.
The important thing is to have a protagonist which ideally shouldn't be a slab of concrete but a person.
A person with a goal, clear and immediate like a back itch.
Have them take steps to pursue their goal in a clever way.
But run into unexpected obstacles
Rising to each challenge brings the protagonist ever closer to their goal while helping them grow as a person,
until finally,
a catastrophic setback all but annihilates their progress and all seems lost
Then a dramatic solution leads them to success
But that success comes at a price, so they return to their ordinary life, forever changed.
Or if you're smart,
they're poised for a new journey full of infinite possibilities,
sequels and merch sales and maybe use a cool catchphrase to crystalize the entire franchise, something like :
Love with your heart, use your head for everything else !

[Intro drumroll]
Greetings, children. Captain Disillusion, here.
So. You want to know the latest, coolest, most interesting viral thing from last month?
There's this audio clip and depending on the frequency the listener is predisposed to pay attention to,
They hear one of two very ordinary common everyday names
Laurel or Yanny
Which one do you hear?
[turns the tape recorder on]
*Explosion*
Holly: I know which one you hear D. It's Yanny, because I hear Laurel and opposites attract.
C.D: Oh joy, Holly's here. 
Holly: How's my favorite dreamy pixel justice crusader?
C.D: What do you want?
Holly: Oh, relax.
Holly: I'm here on official business
C.D: Glad to see you learn to create an artificial body instead of, you know... abducting a corpse.
Holly: I've got a video I want you to explain 
C.D: Portraits? I don't do portrait videos.
Holly: Oh, come on, it's your favorite kind: simple but perplexing, short, but high-quality, and freshly out of date.
Look. It's a machine that sorts a pile of marbles by color, but there's no electronics.
You just bounce through a bunch of pegs and all fall into the right place. How does it work?
C.D: Since when do you care about techie stuff?
Holly: I've always cared about interesting phenomena be they organic or technological in nature.
C.D: Yeah. Well, it's fake. 
Holly: No, it's not.
It's just a clever sciencey invention. Are you sure?
C.D: *Clears throat* Yes, I am Holly, how are you not? You don't even have to look that closely, you can just listen.
Thousands of marbles are cascading down through 75 pegs in this contraption; so, why does it sound like only a couple hundred?
I can practically hear the gaps in the waveform between bounces, even though in the picture a bunch of marbles are mid bounce on any given frame.
And toward the end, as the last few marbles fall through, we don't hear fewer individual bounces, just the same continuous sound fading down.
Holly: Okay, but that doesn't automatically prove the video is fake
C.D: No, but it doesn't bode well. And the video side raises plenty of its own questions. What is this thing? How is it constructed?
The conveyor of little claws on the side looks like it's meant to load the marbles back to the top, but there's no axle to rotate it.
How does it hang up there? How's it driven? Same with the hatch that releases the marbles.
Where is the mechanism that opens and closes it?
Holly: Hmm... true. There's not much there, but it looks so realistic.
C.D: Sure, and if you dig up the original video, it even shows what most re-posted versions littering the web don't:
A hand pressing a button to start the drop.
Except it does it in a strange way. When I press a mechanical button, I tend to first train my finger right on it then push for just long enough to trigger it.
This hand lands straight on the button from inches away and stays on it in a frozen pose for a weirdly long time.
Holly: You're not saying the hand is fake?
C.D: It's real, but projected on a 2D plane as part of a complete CG rendering that looks a heck of a lot like the work of Konstantin Otrembsky,
A Russian digital artist who makes animated graphics for television.
Holly: How in the world did you figure that out?
C.D: I Googled it. It's on his YouTube and his Instagram, and even the secret Russian Instagram.
The evidence is pretty compelling wouldn't you say?
Holly: Yeah, I guess...
C.D: What's the matter? 
Holly: It's just...
I'm dying.
C.D: Oh?
Holly: Well, not all the way dying just losing my powers.
It seems fewer and fewer people engage in magical thinking anymore, and without their belief...
I'm just not as strong as I'm used to being.
C.D: Oh.
Holly: But... I remembered you saying, or was it Carl Degrasse Dawkins?
I don't know, one of you brilliant guys. That the real science based world is full of wonders.
That there's greater magic in nature and the cosmos than any fantasy writer could ever dream up
C.D: Yeah, that sounds like something one of us would say.
Holly: So we want to learn it all! Mathematics, biology, physics, teach me! I'm a fast learner.
C.D: Well, that's very admirable. I mean, physics is very much involved in the faking of this video.
Holly: Really? 
C.D: Yeah, after all it was done with a physics simulation.
When you need to animate a ton of objects falling and colliding with each other, you don't want to do it by hand.
Instead, you set up all the physical conditions for the scene virtually and then run a simulation of what would happen.
Lots of 3D software can run physics sims, but they're not always perfect.
The start of a simulation can be shaky as all the forces suddenly activate.
Some objects might jitter and pop. When the marbles are first released in Konstantin's simulation, one stray one at the top bounces up inexplicably.
Another giveaway of a simulation shows up when something's slightly off in the delicate recipe of scale, gravity, object mass, and other settings.
The hand gives us a good scale reference for the marbles being less than a quarter inch in diameter.
If that's true, these individual bounces seem too high and slow to me. It's as if the marbles are impossibly light or have stronger than normal air resistance
Maybe this was necessary to arc direct them into filling all the slots at the bottom evenly, but artistic license is not valid in the state of believable hoax
Holly: That's so cool. Umm, while you were explaining that I some googling and these things are actually called Galton Boards. They're are all about probability.
How many marbles will fall into each slot, and there's actually a formula to-
C.D: Exactly! So how could this one possibly sort color?
Holly: It can't, it's fake. You're right.
But some people have made some really interesting designs for actual marble sorting devices
There's this brilliantly simple one by pocket83, that just uses gravity to sort marbles by size.
Or this cute one by alexpikkert, which has a color sensor driven by an Arduino board.
I bet if we put our heads together, we could figure out how to build a version of Konstantin's galton board that actually works.
C.D: Yeah, probably. But that's not what he did.
He faked it.
With visual effects.
Holly: Right.
C.D: The question is ""how?"" What were the steps? And the answer is as follows.
First: He shot an empty background plate. Probably not with a phone,
The rolling shutter is too extreme on those to do accurate motion tracking, which is what he did next.
Then he made a 3D model of the galton board and placed it in the scene. Now, because the marbles are spherical and featureless,
He didn't even have to run a proper rigid body simulation to calculate how they fall. Their rotation doesn't matter.
So he just linked each marble to a particle, an infinitely small point on which he set the boundary of influence to the radius of the marbles.
This type of simulation is much simpler. The primitive particles fall and the marbles just come along for the ride.
Holly: Wait, how did you just show that? The empty background and unrendered models?
C.D: Oh, I... found them...
C.D: Oh, I... found them... on Konstantin's Vimeo page.
Holly: We can get Adafruit optical RGB sensors for $8.99 a piece, and I think I have a concept for a sorting mechanism that uses vibrating pegs.
Although I will have to do some more research on resonance, there might be some issues there; but I can go get all the materials right now.
C.D:  Wait a minute. I don't just look things up!
I deduce! There's much more to it. I mean even with everything I explained so far, you don't know exactly how he faked the actual color sorting, do you?
Holly: I guess not.
C.D: And you want to know, don't you?
Holly: Sure...
C.D: Well, small adjustments might affect a simulation every time it runs, making individual marbles fall differently.
Not something you want if you plan to render the scene multiple times, or have an exactly predictable end state for all the moving objects.
But unlike in the real world, CG physics can be baked.
Converted from on-the-fly calculations to keyframed animation, fixed permanently on every frame.
Once the path of each particle was fixed, all Konstantin had to do was go to the end of the shot, select each group of marbles, and give it a different tint.
In other words... 
Holly: He did it backwards.
C.D: No, he did it in rever- Yes, exactly!
See? It's all about thinking outside the box, working with the information you have to come up with the most likely scenario.
I might not have found the creator of the video, the simulation could have been flawless.
But I'd still spot something that gives away the video's fakeness. Some fundamental clue that makes the whole thing impossible.
Like for instance, the fact that before most of the marbles have fallen, they block the view through the board; allowing us to focus on the perfectly clear reflection in its flat, glossy surface.
A reflection, that despite facing us directly, shows no camera phone, or a person holding it.
Holly: D... My body is already a hologram. I have enough visual effects in my life. I want to go further, observe and figure out things about the universe that aren't known yet.
C.D: Well, I... Can't help with that...
Holly: I know.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go, kids. An accountant in Irkutsk is about to follow her weekly horoscope advice with disastrous results!
Holly: Oh, wow! Mu Cephei's core is finally about to collapse!
I've got to get to my observatory in the Elephant's Trunk Nebula to take real-time readings of the supernova!
C.D: Okay, that's a little cooler. I guess I'll see you around.
Holly: Yeah, I'll be back.
C.D: Maybe you can teach me some of this fancy stuff you're gonna learn, sometime.
Holly: I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friend zone.
C.D: Remember, love with your heart, 
Holly: Use your head for everything else."

The problem with the world is that different people know different amounts of things about... things.
As an expert in visual-effects who never makes any mistakes ever,
I might look at an amusing video like this and eventually spot a series of visual clues
that would lead me to suspect it's fake.
A different person, say with nine years of experience in the airforce,
might find other reasons to doubt its authenticity.
And of course, with your brilliance you just know it's fake right away and will make a point of saying that
under every single one of my videos.
But what if we're a hypothetical person who doesn't know anything. Can we systematically figure out
if it's real without any inside information?
Yes we can.
Let's make a list of the things we definitely know or can reasonably assume.
The video moves at 24 frames per second - well, 25, but a frame repeats at the end of every second
so I think it was improperly exported at some point during all the rampant reposting.
Seriously I can't even find the original source!
A wide field of view camera mounted inside the tiny cockpit probably means it's a GoPro.
There are different models and their focal lengths range from 14 to 34 millimeters, so let's estimate 24.
And the jet appears to be a McDonnell Douglas F-18 Hornet, which is 55 feet long.
I know that because I consulted some people who worked in and around similar aircrafts.
Seeking informed opinions of experts in the field is very useful at this stage.
You never know what you're gonna get!
A no-nonsense F4 Phantom 2 pilot from the 80s might take one look and bark,
""It's a cartoonish fake!""
Or retired lieutenant colonel David ""Beaker"" Kent might examine the video frame by frame
and give you a multi-page dissertation detailing every possible technical issue,
from the large control surface deflection that would be required at such slow cruising speeds,
not seen in the aileron motions of the jet, to the fact that the attachment points on the bizarre arsenal of
munitions it's carrying, each have specific g-force limits that would not stand up to these maneuvers.
Intercept procedures, fuel requirements, FAA regulations - his report is a work of art.
Which... I'll take into consideration,
but eventually we're gonna have to conduct our own analysis.
Knowing the focal length, the frame-rate and the size of the aircraft, is actually enough for us
to plot its relative motion in 3D space. When I line up this 55 foot-long virtual measuring stick with the jet
on the first frame of its breakaway maneuver, it ends up 39 meters away from the camera.
When I do it again, 10 frames later, it's 139 meters away. The jet traveled a hundred meters in 0.4 seconds.
Now the average nerd experiences G-force induced loss of consciousness after 4 to 6 G - way to ruin the curve.
With special equipment, trained pilots can handle as high as 9G.
But in this moment, as our jet accelerates at 240 meters per second squared,
the pilot would experience over 24 G, and the vertical climb looks even more severe.
Even I would get slightly lightheaded.
Real-life jets move in slow motion by comparison. Here's what an actual wave by an F-15 looks like.
And here's a real break maneuver.
This one's from a video by Destin from ""Smarter Every Day"", back when he took a ride in a T-38 training jet.
In fact, you know what, I'd better call him up and ask for permission to use that.
Hey Destin. How's it going?
Doing great Kevin, how are you doing?
That video you have about experiencing g-forces in a jet? Must have been fun to make, huh?
Yeah, I mean it's a fighter jet. That's like the definition of like fast and exciting, and yeah, it's awesome.
Cool, cool... So listen, do you mind if I use a little piece of that in my own video?
Yeah, of course! I love your work, man.
I'll credit you of course. You know, I'll throw a link to your channel, give you a little bit of exposure...
Ex- exposure...
One second.
- What the...?!
- Ask me again, go.
Can I... use your video in my video?
Absolutely! But when you do, make sure you look at the pixels on the ailerons,
because as the plane moves you can see displacem-
No, no, you know what? I'm not gonna stand here and pretend like this is not insulting.
In what universe did you think it's okay for you to just... just dress up like someone and make fun of the way they talk?!
I'm not making fun of you! This is an homage. You- I mean, you remember the video you made, right?
You... saw that?
That's completely different, okay? That was for comedy and satire, I was in character and it's... you know what,
I don't want to talk about this, all right? Thank you very much for the permission, I'm gonna let you go.
- I have a letter-
- [Distorted] Remember Captain!
L-Love with your brain and not your heart.
That's not even the way it goes!
Anyway...
Once we're finished with all the objective analysis, it's time to apply our own special expertise.
I know one thing: if this *was* done with visual effects, then the Lazyology principle applies.
The Creator probably didn't build a fighter jet model from scratch, or even render a complex 3D scene.
Why bother, when they could use a fast and easy After Effects plugin? Maybe Element 3D,
supplemented with the Jet_Strike library pack. Maybe they just browsed the assets and clicked on one, say...
Supersonic_Jet_02, a fully textured and articulated model, picked an appropriate HDRI and roughly
matched the lighting based on the angle of shadows in the footage. They knew matching the plane's motion
to the wobbling environment outside would give it that extra realism kick. When we stabilize the background,
the plane stabilizes with it and you can see just how simple and stilted its animation really is.
What the creator didn't take into account is the distortion the wide GoPro lens adds to the image.
When we compensate for it, the image straightens out but the jet gets distorted in the opposite way.
It wasn't really there.
As for the pilot, I'm not sure if he was miming these actions on purpose or just reacting to something else.
He's certainly not behaving the way you'd expect in this situation, but now thanks to all our meticulous research
and analysis, we can stage a more true-to-life recreation of this incident,
and I think it would go a little something like this.
Ah! Sector! Sector! S199T here, I've got a... fighter jet off my left wing! What's going on out there?!
I- I- don't shoot I'm complying!
I'm compl- Aaaah!"

When you’ve analyzed
as many trick videos as I have,
you develop a sense for it.
That’s simple wire removal,
that’s just a thing that happens
when you do that,
and this is, of course, a person in green
keyed out from under plastic…
hmm.
Well, you can see the second guy
through the first one,
and you can kinda see the underside
of the sheets with no one there,
which is not something you can just—
and the whole thing is happening
in a real, moving shot.
For the first time ever,
I’m at a complete loss as to
how in the world this could’ve—
Oh, okay, I got it. I got it.
Um, but I can’t really explain it to you.
See, this isn’t just some gag
by a kid on the internet.
It’s part of a whole series
of legitimate video art
by a digital artist
with a Star Wars–worthy name
of Kiyan Forootan,
and to break down the super-advanced
techniques he used to create this,
I’d have to basically first give you
an entire background fundamentals course
in computer graphics.
So let’s do it.
[clears throat]
[piano music]
Points connected by lines form a polygon,
which defines a flat surface.
Many polygons interconnected
at various angles
define three-dimensional structures
in the computer so efficiently
that a 3D model of this fake cap
could totally fit on a floppy disk.
Ah, crap. That was an antique.
Of course, it would look
like total garbage unless it’s shaded.
Through various algorithms
to smooth out polygon edges
and calculate how light would interact
with surfaces in the real world,
we can mix a bunch of textures
and make the models look very realistic.
The resulting image files are much bigger,
and the time and processing power
it takes to render them
can overwhelm even computers like this—
Ah, [bleep]. That was brand new.
To make the models move
like in all your favorite animated films
and games and… game-films,
we have to puppeteer them by hand,
but virtually,
like stop motion, but better.
But also we don’t have to.
Sometimes we can just make human monkeys
jump around in the real world
and capture their motion.
Real human monkeys are prone to forming
overly high opinions
of their own performance,
but motion capture data
is humble and low-maintenance
and can be applied to anything,
like a monster house!
Or all the surreal dancers
in this Major Lazer video.
But not this dancing baby from the ’90s.
This wasn’t done with motion capture.
Stop thinking it was.
And sometimes the animation
can be procedural,
where we make math do all the work
by simulating real-world dynamics.
There’s particle dynamics,
rigid body dynamics,
soft body dynamics, and cloth dynamics.
Congratulations, you now understand
everything about
computer-generated images,
with the exception of a few minor details.
Now, let’s reexamine
the Dancing Phantoms clip
with your new, educated eyes.
Kiyan filmed a real background,
tracked the camera motion,
and placed generic
human 3D models into it.
He then threw virtual sheets over them
using cloth simulation.
To make those look real,
he also probably photographed
a spherical panorama of the location
so that the environment
cast light and reflections
onto the sheets.
And finally, he just…
turned off the humans.
But the most important element
of this whole thing is, of course,
the motion-captured dancing,
and to recreate that,
I spent a few thousand dollars
on a state-of-the-art
active marker optical
performance capture system that can…
wait, I’m being told now
that you can actually download
all kinds of motion capture samples
for free from the Internet.
That’s probably what Kiyan did.
But it makes me wonder.
If the dance motion capture is pre made,
and the sheet behavior is simulated,
and each of theses phantom clips
is set to commercial pop songs,
[“U Can’t Touch This” plays]
Then what part of this is the actual art?
Is it the shiny colorful plastic?
I guess the shiny colorful sculptures
of Jeff Koons are considered good art
and so are the infantile scribbles
of Robero Britto,
but Jeff Koons has been known
to copy other creative works
and has been sued for it.
And Brito sued others
for copying his style,
and that Major Lazer video
isn’t a Major Lazer video at all,
it’s an intro for an awards show
made by Method Studios,
and even though Kiyan Forootan is nowhere
in the credits of this project,
the stylistic similarities are striking.
And guess which predates which.
[chuckles]
The art world is terrible.
I’m glad I’m on YouTube."
"
Well, well, well. Look who's come crawling back for another episode.
It's the people who love me: the artist, formerly known as Captain Disillusion, heretofore to be referred to as
The Big 'D'
That's right. That's called a jump cut! Oof! Hat hair...
After my recent publicity stint, and views bump,
It's become clear that I got to get a little more professional about this whole YouTube thing...
You know talk a little bit faster, cut a little bit sooner...
I'm talking daily videos, broader topics, and above all,
fan engagement...
So what do you guys got for me?
'Hey Captain, I recently saw this video online, and being naturally skeptical, thought you might find it interesting.'
What the hell is wrong with you... Kyle?
'When I was like 15 years old, I fell in love with the skeptic...'
whoah
Oh, '...Mindset.'
Come on give me something to work with. Oh, here's one. There's not even the message.
It's just a video. Like, 'do this one debunk boy.' Okay, I would--
*sigh* Geez...
Are we really-- Is this really what's gonna happen, is this what we're doing?
I'm gonna have to--okay, Let's, Let's do it. That's fine.
[Sarcasm] Well look at the crazy Chinese man with the blanket of invisibility.
How could this possibly be possible?-- Oh wait. There's a disclaimer right there 'not real.'
[Sarcasm] I'm so glad you told me that, because I was about to... call the CIA.
Tim, what do you want me to say about this?
That we all, all of us, in the entire world, know that this is a green screen?
Like he's holding a green cloth, and then it's keyed out with the empty background
from the beginning? Except of course,
It's probably not green... cloth because everything else around him is green?
This is probably blue? Blue screen, like we've been using for a million years?
Which is another thing, people always on my case about why do they use blue.
Which I don't know why you even care about little historical details like that.
I mean yeah, when I was a s-small-- [Glitch sounds]
[Imitation] When I was a small boy, motion pictures were shot on film.
Which was covered with a compound called
Silver Halide (AgX).
These silver halide particles were extremely photosensitive,
and when exposed to light by the camera, they would burn. Like witches.
Then the unexposed particles would be washed away through a chemical process,
leaving behind a negative image.
And this is how it worked in black and white
The Technicolor version of this would employ three strips of film,
each sensitive to one part of the spectrum,
red, green, or blue,
and then combine them together for a full-color picture.
[Music from clip] But the filmmakers realized they could use the blue strip for the blue screen process because
not only is it farthest from human flesh tones,
be they a Black Panther or White Asian Lady.
But the blue strip also happened to have the finest grain.
Which in today's terms we might think of as resolution.
Of course all this was a rather primitive approach which did not look very good.
Later a brilliant man called Petrov Vlahos
was pressured by Hollywood studios to develop a better method.
There's a famous story about Mr. Vlahos
sitting on the toilet, pondering this technical challenge,
And as a piece of waste fell into the water beneath him,
he exclaimed, 'I shall make it more complex!'
[Imitation of Brady Haran]
Wow! Is that really true, professor?
Well that is the story,
But--but--but
[Immitation] But then humanity said, 'hey, polluting our planet with tons of plastic and chemicals
seems lame and expensive.'
How about instead we make movies using--
[Autotune] digital technology!
A few guys were like, 'no way Jose!'
'I love the crappy look of film, and I'm going to keep using it. Also,'
[Autotune] 'vinyl records sound better.'
The rest of the world said, 'Okay, you do you, grandpas.'
We're gonna stick silicon chips in our cameras that have microscopic photo sensors
and make the Eastman Kodak company file for
[Autotune] bankruptcy.
This was called the digital cinema revolution.
A change so monumental, we're still
[Autotune] experiencing its After Effects (CC 2018).
[Glitch sounds] Whoa--
What just happened there?
It got a little too... Educational.
I'm an entertainment channel, I shoot my vlog on an Apple watch!
I do the chroma key by pressing a button in my app labelled, 'Background Boo!'
So don't come to me with wack questions like, 'how come in the digital age,
we now mostly use green screen instead of blue?'
[Chuckling] T-to understand that you would--
[Glitch sounds] Fir--fir--
first need to ask yourself a simple question.
Whom is this technology for?
And the answer almost always is: apes.
Descendants of apes whose retinas evolved much more sensitivity to luminance than to color.
Being able to detect a lion leaping at your face
takes precedence over being able to admire its majestic mane.
A nd what little color sensitivity our retinas have
is extremely biased toward green.
Probably because of all the green.
So when devising a way to distribute red, green, and blue
wavelengths of light onto a limited number of elements on a photo sensor array,
a scientist named Bryce Bayer
invented, and swiftly patented, the Bayer filter.
A recursive pattern that dedicates half the sensors to green,
and splits the other half between red and blue.
Why bother imitating reality, when you can simply imitate
an ape's perception of reality at one third of the cost?
A version of the Bayer filter is present in every camera using a CMOS chip,
from the phone in your pocket, to the Red Epic stereo rigs that filmed all four hundred and seventy four
excruciating minutes of The Hobbit trilogy.
Each gives us a decent red, channel and abysmally noisy blue channel,
and a crisp clean green channel with effectively double the resolution
Making green the obvious choice for chroma key work.
And by choice I of course mean the illusion of choice,
spread like wispy strands of a fragile web of free will,
pathetically cocooning our ape brains until they die.
Followed closely by the heat death of the universe.
Stop it. Stop it! Stop this!!! Stop it! What is that?
*panting* I'm trying to have a party here
Hey, I know, let's check out some green screen fails, huh?
Because it doesn't matter how good the tools are, YouTubers are gonna find a way to
*explicit* it up.
Let's check 'em out, and we don't have to go far.
How about these guys, huh?
They tried to fool me on their podcast with their little stunt, but you didn't fool me,
did you, Ethan? Hila? I knew!
And so did everyone else in the livestream in the first five seconds!
Maybe because the little fat borderlines like that one. You know why those happen? Do you?
It's because as--as-a-a-a-a--
as brilliant as the bear pattern is, it is after all a pattern,
it needs to be demosaiced, or 'debayered,' to look like a normal image.
Now, simple interpolation, where RGB values of neighboring pixels
are averaged to fill in the missing information,
works fine.
...for solid colors and smooth gradients, but across hard edges can introduce
artifacts. And these,
are green-screen killers.
When the shortest path between two complementary colors is gray,
it may look natural in context.
But take one of the colors away, and you're left with a big fat
glaring edge.
And then video compression comes along, and knackers things up even further.
The solution of course is an algorithm
that attempts to make decisions about where to interpolate, and where not to.
And while designing better algorithms is best left to the camera manufacturers,
we content creators have our own set of tricks, whether using softer lighting,
wider dynamic range cameras, or filling our scenes with less saturated colors that we can enhance after keying.
You might even realize my trademark red shirt is in fact,
light pink.
[Out of character] One take! Haha!
Okay, whatever's causing that is seriously uncool! *panting*
I tell you what is cool though. I was at a party in a friend's yacht last night,
and there was this girl
she was so f--oh my God look at this friggin guy!
Look at that green screen!
He's supposed to be this CGI guru, right?
so how come his matte edges look like he's been cut out of a page of teen magazine
with safety scissors?
And his hands constantly crashing into the edge of frame.
Dude, what did you even key this for?
Just keep it as picture in picture!
And the ginormous background shadow?
You know he can get rid of that procedurally, right?
I mean it all comes down to--oh no! Not aga-a-ain!
If we're tasked with keying something on green screen,
like this fluffy bunny,
[Jazzy background music] our natural inclination is to adjust all of the effects parameters until it looks right,
until we've achieved an optimal result.
But what if the green screen itself is lit sub-optimally?
What if no combination of sliders and knobs gives us the perfect key?
Are we doomed to brute-force our way with garbage masks and rotoscoping?
Well, not necessarily.
19th century British educational writer, William Edward Hickson, is credited with popularizing the proverb,
'If at first you don't succeed, try try again.'
And I'll try to use that here as a loose dot connect to the idea that we are in fact allowed
to use the chroma key effect more than once.
This opens up interesting possibilities.
We can dedicate the first instance of the effect to broadly cut away all parts of the background
that must be transparent, and fill all parts of the foreground that must be opaque.
Then, inflate the border. This way, a second instance of the effect no longer needs to
deal with the image as a whole.
We've limited its influence to the area immediately around the edge,
so we're free to adjust its settings more finely.
And if that doesn't do it, we can keep adding iterations, until it's perfect.
This iterative approach works for more than just green screen.
We see it in art, in construction, and education.
The very orbits of celestial bodies are iterations of freefall.
[Uplifting music] As is the wave-like behavior of electrons and atoms that make up all matter in the universe
In a very real way,
We are
the green screen.
Why shouldn't we be able to key anything we want?
*crying*
Why does this keep happening?
Why you guys so curious?
I just want to fool around and make you laugh.
Can't we all just relax and have fun? I just I want to show yo--
I wa--I wa--
Wanna sh--No. No!
I want--I wanna--
I want to show you guys something I figured out about my green screen.
See I've been using it forever, and it's working fine, but to be honest,
it just--it wasn't very green.
So I decided to measure just how green it is with a tool called a Vectorscope,
which maps a video signal's hues and saturation along two axes.
Now that eight o'clock square right there is where the
ideal colored green is supposed to live.
And you can see it's not pointing there. It's skewing towards cyan!
This just about did my head in. I couldn't understand it.
My lights are properly tungsten-balanced, and so is my camera.
What's going on?
So just for kicks, I switched the camera's white balance to daylight, to 56 Kelvins.
And bam, just like that, it pointed straight to the green vector
Great, but now I've got another problem: my foreground is gonna look all orange!
I'm filming tungsten light on a daylight setting,
so now I have to light it with a separate set of
Daylight balance lights. Which makes sense if you think about it.
you're supposed to have separation between your background, and foreground on green screen.
And basically the manufacturers of this one found a genius way to make sure you do it.
Something just clicked in my head when I realized that.
Luckily, I had my high-speed camera rolling and we captured the moment:
[CC note: this is a beautiful sound]
Now I may be just a simple rocket engineer,
but this inanimate object was able to teach me something,
to make me smarter yet again.
[Glitch sounds]
*crying*
Maybe this is not so bad.
Maybe the YouTube educational space is the place to be.
Maybe all good entertainment contains a little bit of truth,
and little bit of wisdom.
Maybe that's the kind of content that can ultimately...
Dare, I say it...

I think we should just go ahead and pronounce the word ""meme"" the way we all read it in our heads:
""meh-meh""
Because ""meme"" already means ""mime"" in French,
So the viral trend we call that should at least involve some actual miming skills,
Like for instance, the Invisible Box Challenge.
You know, the thing that was a thing for a while where you try to convincingly step over nothing?
It truly took off when someone actually managed to do it well.
And that ""someone"" was...  let's see...  ah yes,
Texas varcity cheerleader Ariel Olivar. Here she is on NBC's Today Show
Explaining how to perform the move in a series of shots that break every possible rule of composition. Let's watch.
Okay, first you to show them there's nothing there
Like a magic trick, and then you lift your leg or no you have to Pat it Pat it
And then you put your foot on top of the box, and this leg has to stay exactly where it is the whole time so
When you jump this leg, that's jumping
And so when you jump
This leg stays in the s...
My God,  you put one foot up and try to keep it in the same spot while jumping really high with the other foot
Anyone can do it. Well, anyone who is strong, lightweight and extremely coordinated
like Ariel and me. Watch this:
Okay, here we go
ooh
O God, I broke every bone in my body!
But for the rest of you indoor types
I'm afraid the only way to meet this challenge is with the help of special effect digital visual effects graphics. Check out this guy:
At first he really struggles
but then suddenly a
Double invisible step!
How? Well, we've cooked this recipe many times before...
Shoot your scene with a static camera capture, a blank background plate, step on a real box
Then use some manual masking to replace the box with the empty background, and add some camera shake to the whole thing.
Simple in theory, but if you try it, watch out for potential problems:
The slightest shift of the camera can ruin the entire shot
Changes in the background make it difficult to patch, and hard shadows falling where they're not supposed to will cause all sorts of headaches
So film on a tripod, under soft lighting
And you'll end up with a nice safe fake video that looks as good, and... bland as a million other trick videos out there.
Only that doesn't feel like much of a challenge.
How about this?
My
totally fake invisible box video breaks all those rules
The camera is handheld and moving, a clear shadow shows my foot not touching anything, and this alternate angle shows I wasn't
Suspended from above. Can you tell how I did it?
I'll reveal the answer on this day in 10 years. So stay subscribed and click that Bell
Ahh
Can't wait that long. I'll just tell you. Okay, after finding just the right location on the mean streets of Las Casas
I filmed the shot with a real box, dotted with tracking markers.
I also put a dense grid of markers on the ground in front of the box
Knowing the exact distance between all these markers helped me
Extract a camera solve and recreate the move in 3D much more precisely than could be done with auto tracking
Armed with this 3D animated recreation I was able to freeze one frame of the pavement without the box
which I made sure to capture right after filming the move and
projected back onto the virtual ground surface making the box
literally invisible
throughout the moving shot. Of course it also made everything else that entered the area disappear, and while the green on the box helped a
Little I ended up manually rotoscoping my hand and foot and their respective shadows to appear on top of the box invisibility patch
Ironically, the biggest challenge was removing the markers that made the effect possible in the first place.
Painting them away in one frame and using the same
Projection method as the box wasn't enough because my shadow moved across them so I picked individual frames where various markers are in shadow
Painted each one out and combined a series of projections until I had a version of the entire grid in shadow
I then used the tracking data to stabilize a
2D projection of my shadow and rotoscoped it to create a matte that controlled when and how the shadow marker patches were revealed.
After some final tweaks and color adjustments I ended up with a pretty convincing take on a meme that
Was already extremely out of date when I started, but I'm not interested in being trendy."

[drumroll]
Greetings children, Captain Disillusion here!
We have done it!
We've cracked teleportation!
Eighty years of scientific research in quantum
entanglement have turned out to be irrelevant, because
in the end, the first interstate portal was opened in the
bedroom of a YouTuber named FunkyFatHead.
He achieved this by playing just the right combination
of audio tones of different frequencies
through a Bluetooth speaker,
until a mysterious glowing window leading directly into
Sedona, Arizona formed above it.
FunkyFatHead - ""It is a well known, uh vortex
phenomenon, there's several of them there,
""and you are witnessing a gate, portal, wormhole,
stargate, whatever you want to call it,
""from this bedroom to another state.""
You know, as I watch the number of views on the video
steadily approach a million,
and the credulous comments about the experiment
outnumber skeptical ones, I can't help but ask;
WHAT THE F*** IS WRONG WITH YOU!?
WHAT THE F***!?
- ""Whoa, Captain, take it easy...""
DON'T F***ING TELL ME TO TAKE IT EASY!! WHAT AM I
DOING!? WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING THIS FO-
It's important when you... disagree with someone's point
of view, to make sure that you... fully understand it.
If I showed you that this collectible T-1000 Terminator
figurine seems to be somewhat alive,
you'd be right to immediately assume I faked it with a bit
of digital warping.
And if I suddenly made a big deal of how a decorative
turtle shell keeps falling off my shelf for no reason,
you'd be right to suspect there's a simple explanation for
how that happens,
But if I took my time and engaged you in an interesting
story about these events,
you might find my cheap tricks start to look more
convincing.
You'd be seeing them in a specific context.
I call this trendy web content technique the
""Piecemeal Paranormal.""
It's when someone shares little tidbits about odd things
they've been experiencing, or experimenting with.
Each individual anecdote is not that crazy,
but over time they get more interesting, and add up to a
disturbingly compelling paranormal narrative.
And a compelling narrative often feels like compelling
evidence.
BuzzFeed-contributing cartoonist Adam Ellis understood
this well enough
to break out of the painful mediocrity of his webcomic
by starting a long Twitter thread about ""Dear David,""
a ghost of a little kid with a bashed-in head who makes
appearances in Adam's apartment.
The tweets began as sections of a first-person horror
story that had a clearly fictional tone.
He saw David in a dream,
he dreamt about another kid telling him the rule of
how not to get killed by David,
don't ask him more than two questions,
and then dreamt about inexplicably breaking that rule,
and now David haunts him.
But after the huge audience response, Adam's tweets
transitioned into earnest reports,
complete with pictures and absolutely terrifying videos
of paranormal activity.
[Captain screams, gasps]
Faceless Russian YouTuber known as Korney
also understood this
when he achieved viral success with an early video on
his pseudoscience channel ""How to Make.""
In it, he explained how to make a homunculus by
injecting a chicken egg with his own... sperm,
and after a few days, extracting a misshapen creature
that appeared to move.
This made the internet somewhat curious, and after
studying viewer reactions and suggestions,
Как Сделать spun off an entire series of progressively
wackier homunculus experiment videos.
His attempts to make a healthy one and getting sprayed
with acid,
Как Сделать - ""BITCH!""
Growing another, feeding it, creating a third,
naming them after Pokémon,
letting them interact until one absorbed the other, and
discovering that the resulting hybrid had teeth,
and was partial to pieces of meat soaked in human
blood.
[cough[ Spoiler alert.
So our friend FunkyFatHead wanted in on this piecemeal
paranormal trend, and started his own channel.
Like the others, he used what's available to him.
Adam Ellis lives in a dilapidated building and owns a
creepy doll,
Как Сделать has access to laboratory equipment,
FunkyFatHead has...
some tacky wall art.
And a bed.
FunkyFatHead - ""Uhh, yeah, I know, sounds nuts.""
His first few videos focus on pretty creative
demonstrations of the ""Mandela Effect,""
but eventually, he discovers that certain sound waves
seem to create a physical disturbance above the bed.
A frequency of 432 Hz opens up a dark mass...
FunkyFatHead - ""...there it is.""
...and gets 710,000 views.
528 Hz fractures space-time,
and earns a less-interested 292,000 views.
But playing a combination of 528 Hz and 525 Hz
opens a gateway to the red rocks of Sedona!
A natural reaction to something like that is of course,
""I want to try it myself to see if it works!""
Several viewers did just that, and... were unable to
replicate the results.
But they didn't follow the protocols closely enough.
I've got the exact same Bluetooth speaker that
FunkyFatHead used.
I've also got my own creepy girl painting, tacky wall art,
white bedsheets with gray pillows,
and the same Szynalski tone generator ready to go.
So let's do this.
Roll sound!
Roll camera!
And... action!
So, uh, a, uh, linear light aperture appears to be forming.
It's, uh, becoming semi-circular in nature.
I'm starting to see some features in the center.
I think it's... it's...
...custard, encased in a pie?
Whoa!
I may have missed some small detail.
Oh, right, everything on FunkyFatHead's channel revolves
around the idea
that his bedroom contains some sort of
transdimensional pocket.
The anomalies happen in it, but not outside.
So don't bother trying to replicate them.
For all we know, they might be unique.
FunkyFatHead - ""It's just a strange thing that's happening
to me right now, so...""
This is a staple of piecemeal paranormal accounts.
There's always some special condition making their
claims impossible to verify.
Adam Ellis's hauntings happen only to him, and only at
his apartment, so you'd have to be there with him,
and even then they don't happen all the time, so
you might not witness it.
But here are some weeeird Polaroids!
Как Сделать claims his homunculus can be made
by anyone,
but also shows it takes countless attempts and
doesn't always work.
The eggs have to be from a small farm, and a bunch of
other special requirements.
And when commenters challenge the validity of his
""science,""
he answers with all kinds of evasive explanations
involving alchemy.
These creators aren't just moving the goalposts,
they've strapped them to their backs.
And that's why you need me.
I don't ""know things"" or ""talk to people."" I stare at videos.
The frames making up those videos, the pixels making
up the frames making up those videos,
and the metadata hidden behind the pixels making up
the frames making up those videos,
until I notice something.
Like the fact that only one video on the channel has
a framerate of 29.97,
the standard for American camcorders,
and it happens to be the one upload that doesn't show
anything paranormal, it's just a vlog update.
The rest of the videos, even though they seem to have been shot with the same camera,
are at an even 30 frames per second, which 29.97 often
gets rounded up to by prosumer video editing software.
Does that automatically mean visual effects were used?
No, but these beautiful volumetric light rays occurring
in a small, smokeless room
definitely look like the ones taught in this AfterEffects
tutorial
by that guy who's too busy to make tutorials anymore.
How dare you keep us waiting for free things
that you make for free!
In order to align the 3D-like effect of the rays, you have to track the camera motion of the shot
by pressing a button and waiting for a little bit.
This also lets you accurately place other things in
the scene,
like an inexplicably flat portal that just happens to be
facing in your direction.
Of course, why would you build and animate a whole
3D model of a cool spherical anomaly when
drawing a simple flat shape and wobbling it with some
procedural noise impresses your audience anyway?
In fact, at the beginning you don't even need to 3D-track
the camera.
Simple point tracking and quick pans do the job nicely.
But with a 3D camera track, you can use the flat portal
as a mask to reveal another object.
In FunkyFatHead's case, it's a large flat plane with a view
from Airport Mesa,
a tourist spot where every hippie goes to experience
magical ""vortexes,""
and every stock photographer takes pictures of this
same vista.
Except this isn't a still picture, we can see the tree
branches moving in the wind.
That means it's a static video of the view which,
if he didn't film it himself,
narrows the stock choices substantially.
And maybe, if we build a composite of the view,
we can all pull together and find the exact piece of
stock footage he used!
Or maybe it was this live webcam.
Hey, let's talk about this lamp!
Before the portal appears, the light from the lamp
overexposes the wall.
Once the portal is in the shot, the camera supposedly
auto-adjusts exposure, and the background gets darker.
But it wouldn't really look like that.
Reducing exposure doesn't dim everything together
like the brightness knob on a TV,
it makes the camera less sensitive to light,
so darker parts go way darker, while bright parts get less
bright, revealing more highlight detail.
The highlight on this wall stays the same because there
was no detail to reveal,
because the camera didn't really adjust, because
there was no portal in the shot.
Because, whether or not flapping air molecules at
certain frequencies can open a portal across space,
It can't.
whether mysterious vortices exist in Sedona,
They don't.
and whether or not FunkyFatHead's bedroom is home to
a transdimensional anomaly,
It's not.
this video is definitely, 100%, fake.
Now your reaction might be:
""Wow Captain! That's incredible! But you're missing the point.
""People GET that everything on these channels is fake,
AND THEY LIKE IT!""
Do they, though?
I tried to tally some comments from each of these three
piecemeal paranormal purveyors
to see if viewers who definitely think the content is fake
outnumber those who definitely think it's plausible.
But I got bored and threw my computer out the window.
On the homunculus video at least, it was exactly
half-and-half between believers and skeptics.
And maybe that's the goal; to create ambiguity.
On one hand, Как Сделать's videos are subtly funny
and just preposterous enough that maybe they're
brilliant satire.
On the other hand, Adam Ellis just straight-up says that
everything he reports about his ""Dear David"" ghost
is completely true.
It cannot possibly be true, but he can write that and
it doesn't seem to matter.
If I secretly installed cameras in his apartment and
offered the world definitive proof that he's making it up,
if I procured raw footage of the homunculus videos
before any warping was added
and showed them side-by-side,
if I deconstructed the rest of the visual effects on
FunkyFatHead's channel,
each of them would just shrug and say 
""Dude, of course, it's not real! I was doing art!
""Don't you know? It's a cool new ironic form of
social media infotainment!
""Letting a little bit of fear-based fiction bleed into reality
for fun and profit!""
But I don't think it's cool.
In art, or health, or politics, in any aspect of life, this blurred line is how you get confusion and mistrust,
and $22,000,000 fruitless Pentagon UFO threat
research programs,
It's how you get 2017.
Do you really want another 2017?
So keep that line sharp.
Enjoy, or hate, or argue with friends over things you know
for sure are entertainment,
but keep a cool, critical eye on what's real and true and
important in everyday life.
You know, love with your heart, but use your head
for everything else.
And let's hope for a less uncertain New Year.

Creative ambitions of directors like Bob Zemeckis push visual effects technology forward, and for Back to the Future 2,
he insisted on another breakthrough that would profoundly impact the way we shoot effects films today.
Between all the flashy flying cars were scenes of characters
interacting with themselves from another time. The same actor playing both parts through the use of the second-oldest effect in cinema history,
the split screen.
Early filmmakers would do split screens in-camera by blocking part of the frame on the matte box
filming one side of the shot and leaving the other side unexposed.
Then they'd wind the film back,
swap the matte, and shoot the opposite side while preserving the already exposed side. As long as the camera stayed still, and the seam of
the double exposure could be disguised on an object in the shot, it worked great.
They were even getting fancy with it pretty early on. A good example is the 1921 Buster Keaton film ""The Playhouse"".
Here he is portraying members of an entire orchestra,
some stuffy audience, comedians onstage and a- Oh, oh, no, let's get out of here.
70 years later,
Robert Zemeckis was determined not to compromise the cinematography
of Back to the Future 2 with static angles and artificial pans and zooms
for the split screen shots. He wanted the camera to move freely as in the rest of the movie.
So in each of these seemingly simple dialogue scenes,
it needed to be driven by a motion control system in real time.
Of course, these days, real-time motion control rigs
are available at every corner web store
but in 1988 there were a little hard to come by.
Some early ones developed by pioneers like John Whitney and Bill Tondreau already existed,
but these were cumbersome machines,
impractical to transport, and way too noisy for dialogue scenes.
So an entirely new silent and portable system had to be created by Industrial Light and Magic
engineers Mike Bolles, Udo Pampel, and Mike MacKenzie,
especially for Back to the Future 2. It was called the Vista Glide. Built on a modified
panther dolly, it could move in a linear track, boom vertically, and operate a
200-pound Vista flex camera with perfect repeatability.
It was the most advanced system of its time.
And we're gonna take it for a test drive. To help me demonstrate how the moving split-screen shots were done,
I've called on the acting talent of London-based youtuber, and fellow Back to the Future fan Ami Yamato.
Ami: Hello!
CD: Are you ready?
AMI: All set.
CD: Excellent!
CD: But we won't be using an ordinary slate for our scene.
Instead we'll trigger the whole system and mark the exact same start frame each take with a bloop-light.
CD VOICEOVER: We begin by carefully planning the scenes blocking and camera angles.
Then the camera rolls and Ami acts out the A-side of the conversation,
while a stand-in reads the other lines.
I operate the camera and the Vista Glide records every nuance of the movements as they happen.
When we finish a take we're happy with we have to commit to it because Ami leaves her cup in a spot from which her
doppelganger will pick it up. It's very important that nothing on the set moves a millimeter, or we'll have to start over.
During the most complex motion control scene in part 2 when Michael J. Fox
plays three members of Marty's future family filming took three days. And all the props had to be glued down to ensure
consistency. The shoot was nearly ruined when an earthquake struck and moved the Vista Glide rig.
Luckily they had just finished filming three hours earlier. Back on our set,
Ami's transformed into her second character through the magic of wardrobe and makeup.
We relaunch the Vista Glide, programmed with the motions of our earlier chosen take, and a video system plays back the take itself.
Hearing audio of her own performance, Ami acts out the other side of the scene as the camera repeats its motion in perfect sync.
By the way,
each axis of movement in a motion control rig is handled by a channel,
and in the Vista glide, there were 16 of them.
Which means it could control more than just the camera. In a few split-screen scenes throughout the sequels, it also moved
objects in the shot. When Tom Wilson passes the almanac to himself in part 2, his hand actually
rests on a rod to which a solid metal replica of the book is securely attached. A motor rotates
it across the split-screen boundary in sync with the camera move and on the B-side
it's the hand of a double. In part three the plate Michael J
Fox hands himself as Seamus McFly is also controlled by a rod later removed with a clean background pass.
With both sides of our scene finally filmed we can roughly combine them on set to make sure things line up and
of course they do. Because the Vista Glide is awesome, and so are the ILM engineers!
CD: And so is Ami Yamato.
All right, well...
See ya!
Ami: Wait, aren't you going to take me back to England?
CD: Oh, yeah, just talk to someone in the production office,
I'm sure they'll take care of you-- all right people, we're moving on! Lots to do!
There was still the small matter of creating a clean optical composite of the split-screen footage. Using a traditional
animation stand they shot backlit cells with carefully painted shapes that defined the exact split.
The camera mount on this animation stand was also motorized and could be programmed with keyframes. So the shapes were
visually match-moved to the camera motion in the scene.
This black and white matte was then used in the optical printer to expose one side of the film frame at a time for the
final composite.
And they didn't have to hide the splits on obvious lines in the scene.
ILM optical departments Stewart Robertson and John Ellis
figured out how to make the double exposure edges almost completely seamless.
The splits could sit in the middle of anything and even fade to a different spot during the shot.
This is what made it possible for characters to hand things off to each other and cross into each other's space.
If it sounds complicated,
it was. Because the high quality picture had to stay on weird strips of cellulose acetate every step of the way.
But then, as part two was being finalized and part three went into post-production,
history began to change...
Film scanning and digital manipulation tools were maturing and ILM's computer graphics department was taking center stage.
Sandra Ford Cartman was one of its earliest members and worked on all kinds of subtle
enhancements to Michael ante Aries physical effects throughout the sequels
Wire and rig removal and the hoverboard sequences this crazy moment when the DeLorean pops a wheelie on the train tracks
Cables connected the nose to Aaron's hidden in the cab
Also digital blue screen work during the climactic train scene because it was impossible to key Mary Steenburgen's purple dress
Optically without severely shifting all the colors in the picture.
ILM had come a long way from the pencil drawn lightning bolts in the first film
But there's one shot that perfectly captures the evolution of effects in the entire trilogy
Fittingly, it starts the middle act of the second movie when Marty and Doc returned from the future to drop Jennifer off at her house.
The DeLorean flies, makes a clean landing pulls into the driveway, and Einstein strolls out of it-- a seemingly unimportant
moment depicted with an incredibly complex visual effect in true Zemeckis style.
Just think, a motion control split screen is being used to hide the real car driving off a
platform on the right side of the post with a pass of the empty street
Then a detailed miniature DeLorean, lit and animated to line up perfectly with the real one (by Peter Dalton) using nothing
but his eyeballs, is shot in multiple passes optically composited into the scene and rotoscoped to disappear behind the post.
To me the moment the DeLorean touched down in this shot is the moment the visual effects industry truly came of age.
It proved that effects are not just for spectacle. That they can become an
indispensable part of visual storytelling and films of all genres.
And sure, they're not perfect in Back to the Future.
The whole trilogy is full of imperfections.
The headlights aren't reflecting on the miniature side here the cap is cut off by the split screen in this frame
Marty's got three hands for a moment a diffusion silk and a flying rig are clearly
Reflected the stunt guy has a super red face. Hello short shorts
you can see a little wheel there and doing the heartfelt conclusion of the entire journey this little guy is pointing at his--
*Train horn sound effect*
But you know what? I've honestly never noticed any of these flaws. I got swept away by the story, and I still do.
When I watch Back to the Future today,
I still root for Marty, laugh at Doc and get goosebumps when the time machine appears on screen.
And as much as I know about the details of the visual effects,
I forget they're there.
All I see is an epic cinematic adventure.
It managed to remain
timeless."

I'm sorry, Captain Disillusion is not available. Please hold for...
Mr. Flare, suckers!
In 2011 (the year everyone realized that fake, sports-based stunt viral ads were officially played out) one brave baseball gear brand called
Easton *record scratch* made one anyway.
Instead of featuring a famous athlete, they used ""some guy"".
And instead of hiring a big ad agency, they outsourced the video to a couple of freelancers.
Hat enthusiast Ross Haris and ""Yo Gabba Gabba"" graphics guy Joel Fox.
In spite of that, the ad was an instant viral hit, and everyone must have rushed out to buy bats,
because Easton followed up with another fake stunt video right away, but this time, barely anyone cared, and Haris and Fox never worked again...
Probably.
I don't know much about advertising, but I can introduce you to the wonderful visual effects philosophy of Lazyology,
which helps viral ads like ultimate batting practice get made on time, and under budget.
First, if you're going to add fake camera wobble to your scene, why bother with procedural animation
or tracked motion from a real handheld reference when you can have weirdly stilted angular movements
with no rotation like this?
I'll pay a few bucks to license this totally random stock photo by Antonio Guiiiiiem
so I can show you how it's done in Adobe afterfectseses two hundred and seventeen.
Let's bring up the motion sketch window, start capture, and drag the picture around very
slightly like a sickly sloth.
If our mouse is cheap enough, we get tha same kind of perpendicular lines!
And the shot may look like it was filmed on a tripod by a drunk robot, but we saved... 2 minutes.
The Lazyology way.
To make the pitchbacks shake from hits by balls that weren't really there,
Don't film a variety of real hits, just sample one, and recycle it for every single impact.
According to the TransLazytive property, no viewer is crazy enough go to the trouble of
lining them all up and playing them in sync to show they're completely identical.
And if you're faced with animating something as complex as tiny white balls,
Don't use some cool plugin to go full 3-D, stop at 2 and a half D
by moving around flat images of balls in 3-D space. That way, the shadows can be narrow and barely visible
so that some people doubt they're even there.
It's all going to look sort of okay in the end when you add the ultimate Lazyological tool:
Motion blur! And lots of it!
But the principles of Lazyology help more than just effects makers.
They also help the people who watch and share their work.
Why bother looking for something new and exciting, when you can just freeboot a thing from 7 years ago?
And why try to figure out how the effects in the 7-year-old thing work
when you can just ask an internet superhero again and again?
Well, guess what?
You don't need a superhero. You only need me, Mr. Flare, to tell you that the ""Yo Gabba Gabba"" guy who did the ad
also posted videos about the making of it!
Half the stuff I showed you is from them!
This one's been on YouTube for almost as long as the ad itself!
It's even CALLED THE SAME THING!!!
All you had to do was type in those words, but... You didn't.
Because you ARE a Lazyology MASTER.
And you've finally earned my respect.
Now never contact me again! Flare out!"

So you're a kid or International Brand that wants to make a video guaranteed to go viral.
You've done your research, looked at what's out there, and quickly realized that trick shots are where it's at.
Videos of people throwing objects at seemingly impossible targets and hitting them are irresistibly satisfying to watch,
and it never gets old either!
Dude Perfect have been making trick shot videos for eight years
and rank as the 22nd most subscribed channel on all of YouTube.
Can you imagine if someone was on YouTube even longer and ranked as 11413th?
It's like, why even bother?
The good news is I can teach you everything you need to know about making trick shot videos.
I'll even demonstrate in the same gravitational environment most of you would be working with.
Uuugh! Ahh... heh...
Basically, you've got your two main types of video.
One where you make the trick shot and act like it's no big deal,
and one where you make it and act like it's the greatest achievement of your entire life!
Whoa! I did it!
Come on.
Whatever the reaction, you're gonna have to work hard to convince people that the video is real,
'cause a lot of trick shots are faked with visual effects, as has been proven again and again.
I've talked about how this ""Guy catching glasses with face"" video was faked for Ray-Ban
by a couple of filmmakers who to this day refuse to admit that I explained their primitive effects correctly...
""There are moments where he was on to us but never really completely nailed, and there are a few instances where he was wrong.""
...and how this NFL Fantasy Files campaign used more advanced techniques to push the skills of professional athletes into the realm of superhuman.
And more recently young Jaden Rollins, drunk on attention, put on a mask and – accompanied by some familiar copyrighted music –
explained the visual effects behind this David Beckham viral video
semi-adequately.
Now, as an accomplished athlete myself,
I don't need visual effects to make trick shots.
My legendary skills on the court are enough.
Scuse me, scuse me!
Here it comes, baby, here it comes!
[Out of breath] Here we go...
[ ♪ Exciting music ♪ ]
Why?
Okay, well, clearly it's not the best weather for this right now, and uh...
my right glute is acting up so
why don't I just explain the visual effects to you?
It's easy if you break the shot down into its essential components:
pick a good stationary angle and capture an empty background plate,
film the ball throw, and erase the miss.
If you're skilled like me, the ball might not even land in the shot, saving you some work.
Film a successful hit made from close range,
trying to give the ball enough velocity to make it look like it was thrown from a greater distance.
If it left the frame after the throw, it's simple to fuse the two shots together.
If it didn't, it's still...
relatively simple.
All you have to do is make a realistic 3D model of the ball,
capture a spherical environment map of the location for lighting,
match the look of the CG ball to the real one,
then animate a transitional motion to bridge the gap between the throw and the hit.
And if the hit never happened in real life,
keep the ball digital all the way to the end,
adding a CG double of the basket and running a physics simulation to guide the motion of the net.
You know, just play around with it.
If you make it look real enough you're not guaranteed a viral video but,
you might just become a good visual effects artist and...
have to move to Canada to find work.
Excuse me.
[Police sirens]
Not all of you are into visual effects though. I can appreciate that.
I don't get it, but I appreciate it.
But what if I told you there's another way?
What if even a sedentary YouTuber like yourself could pick a target and,
without gimmicks, without effects or editing tricks of any kind,
walk 18 feet away and score a perfect shot?
Piece of cake.
The secret? Time, effort and a healthy appreciation of probability.
The quick scene you just saw made it look like I'm great at talking and throwing a ball
because it unfairly represented my success rate at both.
In reality it takes me an average of five attempts to say any line coherently...
""As is the case with some of these crazy... dashboard camera... f**k.""
...and a link in the description will lead you to a 21-minute video showing
the 37 agonizing takes of raw footage it took to capture this successful throw.
Watch if you dare.
Or check out this video some students made,
measuring how the probability of scoring a basket decreases with distance.
""To use this equation substitute x for the distance in meters.""
They did well, but left an important factor out of their calculations:
the participants' skill level and how it grows over time.
After throwing the ball at my target dozens of times in a row,
adjusting my aim, and getting used to the weight,
it probably wouldn't take me as many tries to get the shot right were I crazy enough to attempt this again.
If I put in months of daily practice I could probably hit the cup on almost every try.
But some people spend most of their lives honing their skills to a level that ends up looking like pure magic to the rest of us.
And when you throw some natural talent into the mix,
like with the members of Dude Perfect, the results are completely unbelievable,
but they actually do these stunts!
They really did set a world record making a shot from the third tier of a stadium,
beat that record from the top of an even bigger stadium,
and successfully shot a ball into a hoop from an airplane on the second attempt!
Dude Perfect videos are real. So please stop asking me about it.
Sometimes people are just really good at what they do.
And if you can't top their skills or figure out a creative original approach,
then maybe this particular genre of viral video is just not for you.
Try filming a sleepy kitten or something.
Or maybe a reaction video.
I hear those are highly engaging."

Look! Up in the news feed!
It's a bird!
It's a dictator!
No! It's...
A bird saluting a dictator through a simple visual effect I explained ten years ago in my first video!
And one thing you need to know about me is that I never repeat myself.
Today's topic is magic.
The f-five categories of magic are:
Closeup, Stage, Animalerotic, VFX-assisted Video Performance, and Dave.
[DAVE INTENSIFIES]
[clears throat]
In May 2017, the mouths of America's Got Talent judges were more agape than usual,
during the audition of a young man performing a fresh take on the classic Coin Matrix Effect.
It started out traditionally, but ended with an astonishing series of instant transpositions and transformations.
How it was done, I... probably shouldn't get into
because when you deconstruct magic tricks, old people on Facebook compare you to The Masked Magician,
while remaining your fan, and rightfully so!
It's a well-believed fact that an illusion can't be entertaining if the audience knows the secret. Look!
These spirals aren't really moving!
See, ruined forever!
How would you like it if filmmakers shared how movies are made?
Or, if animators revealed the technical details of their ""mystical craft?""
Why, the content they produce would instantly lose all commercial value!
When Penn &amp; Teller unleashed their infamous transparent cups and balls routine,
it nearly destroyed the entire magic industry!
And their career is still in shambles.
So I'm not explaining the trick.
I won't call attention to the fact that the table's really thick, a conspicuous thing covers his right foot,
and the coins vanish and reappear in the exact same spots every time,
I simply won't!
But I will give you one clue.
Take a look up here, at the guy attached to the hands. Who is that, anyway?
His name is Will Tsai, and you can find videos of him demonstrating all kinds of magic tricks as impressive as his audition.
One even made a splash on Reddit, with lots of users confidently offering wrong explanations of the method.
Will's videos are perplexing and fun, like Magic Vines,
I mean, Instagrams,
except instead of cheap digital effects, they feature real-world, impossible to explain sleight of hand.
And just as magic Instagrams are ultimately designed to advertise the Subaru Outback,
Will's videos are designed to promote something, too.
You see, as you go on living your safe little life,
an unseen network of magic vendors churns beneath...
On websites familiar only to the socially... different, secrets are for sale.
Instructions for learning routines and building gimmicks that endow you with powers to manipulate the very fabric of reality
are on sale this month.
Oh, cool! I've been looking for that one!
These collectives make a business out of selling magic trick secrets to consumers,
and fight to protect them from each other.
Will Tsai designs particularly elegant products as a resident artist at SansMinds,
a company which, a while ago, got into a confrontation with another vendor, World Magic Shop,
over the ownership of a particular illusion.
This was a bitter feud, with angry emails, threats of legal action, and public statements.
The word ""ethical"" came up a lot.
I haven't witnessed tension like that since the recent Nova vs. Community Channel YouTube faceoff of 2007!
But it got me wondering.
Hypothetically, would it be ""ethical"" to promote one's work as a designer of commercial magic products
with videos that use visual effects?
Because, did I forget to mention? Will Tsai's magic trick videos use visual effects.
In fact, other than demonstrating his products, I can't seem to find a single clip of him performing magic
that isn't at some point augmented with editing, even in this supposedly live Hong Kong special.
And since, unlike magic tricks' secrets, visual effects belong to the people,
I have no problem explaining them.
All the tricks on Will's YouTube Channel involve manipulating objects normally in real time,
then adding or removing elements in post to create the actual trick.
These videos all use rig removal techniques to erase:
A dropping coin, and a hand placing it back,
a card falling into the lap,
a bill reemerging under the Sharpie,
and a coin continuously spinning on the table.
It's done very cleanly, with reconstructed pieces of the background and clothing showing only the tiniest evidence of manipulation.
A subtle shape-shift in the vest, the reflections in the metal shirt beads freezing briefly,
and the real shadows of the hands blending in and out of shadows captured separately
in a take where the hands didn't obstruct the table, and the coin wasn't on it.
In these videos, more blatant visual effects are used,
whether animating a still frame of a finger while masking away the real one to make it appear detached,
tracking an image of a 9-volt battery on top of a pair of double As until the moment they're flicked apart,
or just shifting the hue of a solid color ukulele through simple secondary color correction,
each trick looks compelling thanks to stellar compositing work, and not Will Tsai's skills as a magician.
He's not a magician.
He's a... ""Visualist?""
But the question remains: if his tricks require visual effects to work,
then how did he successfully pull off a live stage performance for a panel of judges on TV?
Well, who says he did?
If we saw magical stuff happen on a table this unapologetically black in real life, we'd easily perceive it for what it is:
A black light theater effect, where people or devices covered in dark velvet material appear invisible against an equally dark background.
All sorts of mechanisms could hide and reveal the coins, even swap them for synthetic rose petals seamlessly,
as long as the right lighting forced our eyes to stay adjusted for the illusion.
But a taped performance gives us the luxury of peering into the shadows.
If we brighten the image, we can bring out lots of detail in Will's shirt, his hair, even the side of the table,
but the same doesn't happen with the table top.
Hmm... no matter how much we boost it, the surface stays pitch-black, other than a few compression artifacts.
And what's going on here?
When the fourth coin appears, for one frame it doesn't move along with the shaking table,
and the reflection of the hand in it is also frozen.
Here, just before the last coin is turned into a rose petal, it also floats in place, ignoring the motion of the table.
Wait a minute.
Are we really saying that the producers of this competition, which celebrates the art of live performance,
modify what happens on stage with editing tricks to make contestants seem better or worse than they did in real life,
to suit the dramatic needs of the program?
Well... yeah.
It's a reality show. It's all fake. They can do whatever they want.
They once made a sideshow magic act look like a world-class, impossible illusion by simply editing out a major give-away part of it,
so they certainly don't have a problem freezing some coins onscreen for an extra frame to disguise the mechanism
that hides and reveals them if it's just not quick enough for 30-frames-per-second scrutiny.
And I guess we have a choice to make.
We can reserve the term ""magic"" for genuine, live, physical illusions
that require clever design and a lifetime of practice to master,
or we can use it as a label for anything tricky or flashy achieved by any means.
In which case, I'd like to show you the greatest, most visually stunning, most inexplicable magic trick of all time.

(drum roll)
Greetings, children.
Captain Disillusion here.
Now that I've
correctly explained
every single video
mystery on the internet,
we can finally dedicate
this channel to more…
grown-up topics.
I'll start off easy by discussing…
religious appropriation
of gendered race politics.
Now, my opinion on the
subject is rather controversial
and it is as follows.
Anyone who--
(fast beeping)
I'm sorry…
(beeping louder)
Apparently there is one more
viral video left to debunk.
And it comes as
a special request
from an ambitious little
boy named Jason Rodgers--
J-Jackson Roberts,
who's made a grassroots
hoax-busting effort of his own!
JACKSON: You've all seen
this video before, right?
I mean, five million of us have.
It's in the ""important videos""
playlist, so it's gotta be popular.
I think a lot of people
have realized it's fake.
I mean, they must have by now, right?
I mean, I can't be the first
one to realize this, right?
Right?
CAPTAIN D: Yeah, yeah.
You're totally not.
Now, get to the point, please.
JACKSON: I think a variety of 
techniques were used,
and that's why I am calling out
(dubstep music)
to Captain Disillusion
to come help me out with this
because this video
was really hard to make
for just this one shot.
So, um, I'm calling out to my--
to my savior, my idol, my strength
Captain Disillusion
to come and help me with this project.
CAPTAIN D: Why, Jensen, that's so sweet!
Of course I'll help!
What have you been able
to figure out so far?
JACKSON: I've figured out
that this is an ad
for glass.
If you see, in the background
of all these shots,
the stickers on the glass say
""Integrity,"" and that's the brand
that produced this video.
And I have no idea
how they're selling it.
I just don't understand
advertising nowadays.
You're a glass company, let's make a 
video about a f*****g tape measure--
(record scratch)
CAPTAIN D: Whoa, okay.
No need for foul language, Jamie.
You're right!
It is a f*****g viral ad.
Those are usually produced by ad agencies,
and if we knew which
agency created this video,
it could lead us
to more information.
So, let me show you
this one weird trick
to quickly and easily
identify the agency
behind any successful viral ad campaign.
All we have to do is search
the name of the brand,
followed by ""viral ad,"" and ""award.""
Advertising firms crave validation
and constantly submit everything
in their portfolio for awards,
so this works every time. See?
The ""Superhuman
tape measure skills"" video
was one of five spots that
Martin Williams Advertising,
an agency that describes itself as
""Charming and relentless,""
produced for Integrity
Windows &amp; Doors by Marvin.
The others weren't as successful,
but with the tape measure spot
they struck a perfect
balance of virality
because precision
tape-measure tossing
seems a little more plausible than 
reproducing the Mona Lisa with a nail gun,
but not as simple to fake
as throwing a single nail.
Now, the whole campaign is from 2010
and has long ago served its purpose,
so maybe if we just ask
Martin Williams politely,
they'll tell us all about
the visual effects in the ad.
(dramatic sting)
(ping)
(Robotic, female voice reads text on-screen)
CAPTAIN D: Well, that doesn't
help us very much.
Looks like I'm going to have to teach 
you some of my world-famous
debunking skills after all, Jeremy.
(clears throat)
First,
a lot of these viral
hoax videos do a trick

You might want to--
(bang)
JACKSON: A lot of these viral hoax 
videos do a trick where they
film everything on a tripod
to make the visual effects easier,
and then they add the
fake camera shake later.
And that was actually done
on a few of these shots.
Here, you can see.
I've stabilized a couple of these shots--
(bang)
CAPTAIN D: Oh. I'm…
glad you know that already.
Well, one thing I like to do
is study shots frame-by-frame
to catch any weird anomalies
that might give away the--
(bang)
JACKSON: Right as the
keys get grabbed,
they actually start moving before
the tape measure touches them,
which is just a complete giveaway.
And then there's one frame, while 
they're being lifted up, that
they sort of stick.
They're on top of each other.
(bang)
CAPTAIN D: That's great.
You're very clever, Jasper.
But you should also consider
that sometimes one shot
might be made up of several
split-screen elements
where different--
(bang)
JACKSON: So there's a plate with
these three guys on the left,
and the one guy throws the tape measure
and then there's another
shot on top of that
of the tape measure
going through the air
starting after the point
where it changes direction.
(bang)
CAPTAIN D: You think you're so cool, 
don't you, Jacob Ronalds.
Like a young Captain D who
doesn't have to dye his hair
or frame himself above the waist.
Well let me tell you something.
You don't even know half
of what you think you've
figured out about these effects.
Now watch and learn as
a professional breaks down
every single shot in the video.
There are six scenes in all,
and, yes, four of them were filmed
statically with fake
camera motion added in post.
But the other two
really were shot hand-held,
as we can see from the parallax
in the deeper parts of the background.
(mechanism shifts)
In the window scene, the throw seems 
simple enough to be done for real,
but stabilizing the shot
in a more thorough way
that counteracts lens distortion
reveals some odd things happening 
with this guy's lower half.
It's an attempt to clean up a cut
hidden in the camera move.
When filming, the main actor
launched the tape measure,
then everyone froze.
An assistant came in,
hooked the end of the tape measure
where it's supposed to land,
left the scene, and then
action was resumed.
The missing motion of
the tape hitting the target
was added later by warping
still images of the real tape.
This could've been done
completely seamlessly,
but without taking
lens distortion into account,
or working out the
exact timing of the cut,
it ended up being a sloppy patch job.
Maybe the assistant was
even visible too early
in the corner of the shot,
and that's what this little
artifact is covering up.
(mechanism shifts)
The porta-potty scene
is also made of two pieces,
but not in the way you might expect.
The tape throw is real!
Assisted by a wire run
through the door handle
and pulled from the inside.
But when the door opens,
the wire operator is
masked from our view
by a different take of
an actor on the toilet.
In both takes, the door was
opened at about the same speed,
and any slight discrepancy was easy
enough to adjust on the tape measure.
But it wasn't so easy
once the toilet guy
starts to close the door in his take.
In the thrower's take, the door stayed open.
We see the real tape measure 
suddenly replaced
with a stretchy, animated mess
that follows the door back.
It wrongly connects to the door
at the edge instead of the handle,
and peeking above it,
we can see the wire
that actually pulled the
door open in the toilet guy's take.
The ladder scene is one of
the genuinely hand-held ones,
and stabilizing it reveals something obvious.
Before the tape measure is launched,
the entire path where
it's going to travel
boils and glitches with
messy cloning patchwork.
Once again, the tape was being
pulled by a wire toward its target.
The cup starts to
get tipped by the wire
before the tape
measure even reaches it.
But the filmmakers couldn't pull the 
tape fast enough over this distance.
So at the start of the shot, the tape 
measure is already partially extended
and hidden by the clone patchwork.
It's rapidly wiped away
until it catches up to
the real end of the tape
just as it bumps the cup.
After that, no visual
effects are happening,
but we can see
the tape bowing
as the end continues
to hang from the wire
instead of diving straight down.
The boombox scene is simple.
First, a blank plate was shot
with the guy in the
background reacting.
Then, the tape measure
was pulled into place
and dropped to capture the action
of it being reeled back in.
The quick throw was easy to simulate later
by once again warping
a still frame of the tape
as well as wiping on
its shadow and reflection.
Except, they forgot
this second reflection,
so it just suddenly
pops into existence
on the frame where
the tape becomes real.
And the boombox
getting bumped
is probably the result
of an on-set mistake.
It must have been moved
slightly between takes,
and this inspired them to animate it
from one position to the other.
But it's done so crudely.
Even down on the
boombox's shadow.
They should've just left it still.
The same ""top-notch""
compositing skills
were applied to the
only scene in the video
where the effects had to look perfect
because the camera doesn't move.
You're right, Jefferson, the keys shift
a couple of frames before
the tape measure reaches them.
It's because the shot cuts to
a version where they are connected
to a clearly-visible filament
that really pulls them off the shelf.
This motion probably
wasn't fast enough,
so it was sped up by showing
only a few handpicked frames,
one of which was accidentally
left visible for an extra frame.
But this is not as weird
as what's happening
on the other side
of the composition.
See, the filming process
was similar to the window scene.
After launching the tape measure,
the actors froze in place,
and an assistant pulled
the tape all the way to the target.
Only this time it was
captured as a visual reference
and then attached to the
keys below the shelf.
The assistant hid, and the
actors resumed their actions.
But the compositor
was left with the task
of seamlessly blending
a glaring jump cut from this
to this.
And they achieved it with
the most obvious morph
in the history of visual effects.
The background guys were easy,
but the main guy's hand needed to 
move in front of his body.
But the morph
was done without it,
and a still frame of the hand
was animated across
until it reached the position of
the real hand in the second shot.
The tape measure itself
was again an artificial element
built and animated using the
reference footage captured earlier.
In fact, there seems to be
an additional morph
on the actor's face at
the beginning of the throw
probably to remove
the real tape measure,
which went up and in front of it.
Also, it's hard to make out,
but at the very end, the keys
slide and stop abruptly at his feet.
This also seems to
have been added in
because the real keys stated attached
to the end of the tape measure,
which didn't make sense.
And, finally, the light switch scene.
Here, the ladder and
the keys methods are combined.
The actors freeze after the throw,
someone pulls the tape
close to the target,
and attaches it to a wire,
which is threaded through
a hole in the stud.
Action is resumed, and the wire pulls
the tape measure across the switch.
Of course, the light switch doesn't 
actually control the light.
It's in the down
position the entire time,
and the light is turned off from
elsewhere at the right moment.
For the first frame of the tape 
measure entering the area,
It's superimposed on top of a
separate shot with the light switch up.
On the next frame, it's the real shot,
and we can even see the wire.
After the hit, the wire operator
once again took too long
to release it back, so the
tape measure lingers there.
The compositor
was forced to wait out
the few frames it takes for the 
incandescent light to dim
before the background could be
switched to a plate captured later,
and a still image of
the measuring tape
could finally be
animated to go down.
Here, it connects to the real tape,
which is masked away
by a pretty clunky matte,
and can be seen still
curving up toward the wire.
Also, this happens.
Was that detailed enough for you, Jethro?
I own this gig!
Do you understand me!?
I own it!
(sighs)
But don't feel bad.
When you step back and look
at the video as a whole,
a picture starts to form.
A picture of a commercial
director just winging it on set
and passing the buck
of making things look real
to some woefully
under-qualified effects artists.
All of it produced by
an agency with a lobby like this
for a high-profile company
on a budget of probably
hundreds of thousands.
Meanwhile, you're a film student
with 29 subscribers, Jackson,
and I can honestly say that the quality 
of work on your YouTube channel
is better than the quality of work
in this whole campaign.
So, yeah.
I don't understand
advertising nowadays, either.

But now I'm afraid it's
time for me to go, kids.

Hmmm...
Remember how the first ever use of CGI reflection mapping in a film
was to create a certain metallic sci-fi vehicle?
Well, ever since then, I get suspicious whenever I see metallic, sci-fi vehicles
in the news.
Like this super cool robot exoskeleton called ""The Method"".
Supposedly being built by South Korean future technology company:
""Hankook Mirae Technology"",
which in Korean means ""Korea Future Technology"".
Look at those pristine, shiny, perfectly lit mechanical parts.
It has to be a computer-generated rendering, right?
Well it's not!
It actually exists!
Yes, already in its second iteration
this magnificent robot suit may be helping humans work in
hazardous environments by late 2017!
According to the company's CEO, Yang Jin-ho,
and according to Popular Mechanics contributor David Grossman,
It could soon see action in the DMZ between South and North Korea.
DMZ stands for Demilitarized Zone, David.
The point is,
the robot is real!
So, thank you, everyone
and, good bye, forever.
Or,
I bet I could disillusion you anyway.
Let's look closer. Past the flattering articles and amused billionaires...
""Why do I feel like- so much like Sigourney Weaver?""
And, exactly what has been accomplished here?
HM are in their third year of prototyping a robotic design
informed purely by popular science fiction.
And while Boston Dynamics tests generation after generation of robots
without any regard for how terrifying they look
until they perfect their functionality,
Hey, come on...
One of HM's first steps has been to hire a Hollywood concept artist
to help design The Method's appearance.
Vitaly Bulgarov
has created concept art for hit video games and films
like Transformers: Age of Extinction and Ghost in the Shell
Age of... OK - not great.
And he's made this thing look pretty awesome!
But, a nicely kitbashed hull and cool interior backlights
don't help with the major technical hurdles the robot has yet to overcome.
Note how there's almost never a person inside when the unit is shown taking steps.
Even with tethers above, it's not yet deemed safe to have the arms and legs operating together.
Probably because the robot isn't technically walking.
It's a pre-programmed sequence of movements.
Not adapted behavior controllable in real time.
I don't think it's equipped to actively fight for balance, BigDog style.
Stop that!
Same with the method's hands.
Right now, their motion is canned and purely decorative.
The only thing actually controlled by the pilot is the movement of the arms.
Achieved through one-to-one motion replication.
This approach was used to get an animated baby Herman
to hold a live-action cigar in ""Who framed Roger Rabbit?"", back in 1988.
And to puppeteer the life-sized animatronic T-Rex in Jurassic Park
in 1993.
And both of those rigs were among dozens of other revolutionary mechanical effects
achieved with a small portion of those films' respective budgets.
Hankook Mirae is working with a budget of $200,000,000 to build one robot.
And, judging by the cables trailing behind it,
computer control may not be on board yet.
If a couple machines and technicians are still needed on the outside
to help this thing move,
then it doesn't seem like a robot that could be ready for industry by the end of
2017 to me.
But,
I'm not a robotics expert.
So let's ask Brian Gregory,
principal engineer at the PTR group,
a company involved, among other things,
in developing high-end robotics for NASA's satellite servicing projects division.
Hi Brian!
(Brian)
Hey Captain D!
Big fan.
I'm excited to talk to you.
(Captain D)
I know, right.
So, this method robot is pretty limited, huh.
(Brian)
Yeah, I'd be concerned, for instance
when it waves it's arms around, it's pretty unstable.
and the centre of gravity shifts when you interfere with it's walking.
(Captain D)
In other words, this thing is basically garbage.
(Brian)
Well, no, I wouldn't say that.
I'd eventually see it as some kind of show robot, you know
like a monster truck rally thing, not really a military or construction kind of thing.
(Captain D)
OK, but would it be fair to say
this project is an insult to the entire field of robotics research?
(Brian)
No...
(Captain D)
Why not?
(Brian)
Ummm,
you seem to be personally offended by this robot,
captain.
(Captain D)
Well, Brian.
Let me ask you this.
If you were some sort of big hero and parts of you happened to be chrome,
and then some company started building a robot that was just
as big and heroic and also happened to have chrome parts,
Wouldn't you be justified in feeling just a little bit insulted?
(Brian)
I'm sure that's not what they're trying to do.
(Captain D)
This thing is not taking my job, Brian.
Not in a million years, OK?
I'm a natural chrome.
Now what are we going to do about this?
Does your team know their team?
(Brian)
I've gotta go, I'm sorry.
(Captain D)
I need a plan of action.
(Brian)
I got a call coming in.
(Captain D)
Don't you hang up. Brian, I need your help.
Br- Brian! Do-
(Brian)
I gotta go.
(Captain D)
He's gone.
Look.
Industrial robotic arms, large animatronics and human piloted machines
are all proven concepts.
The job of the method
is to prove they can all work together in this form-factor.
And it hasn't done that.
Until it can balance itself,
negotiate obstacles or pick up objects,
it's just a shaky assembly of moving parts
impressing us purely through pareidolia
because it looks vaguely like a person.
Or a thing we've seen in a cartoon.
So, even though it's not a CGI hoax,
the method is not really the machine it's claimed to be, either.
Not like these things.
OK, you know what?
I'm gonna go find the guy who keeps doing that,
and give him a taste of his own medicine."

Hey, Siri, find me a viral video that's bizarre, funny...
and also I can tell how it's done.
SIRI: Okay, Captain Anti-white.
What?
Ah, this clip by YouTuber Magia Jepaint...
of a crazy guy playing in traffic is pretty good.
But... it only has 59 thousand views.
How can we properly viralize it?
Let's grab it off that channel, wedge it into a square...
and shove the square back into a rectangle...
as we post it on our own page.
Of course, we'll need to fill the margins with something.
These margins... are where true creativity lives!
How about...
[laughs] Nice work, Student Problems.
But... it's a little too relatable.
I don't want to laugh WITH the guy,
I want to laugh AT him.
How about...
[chortles] That's what I'm talking about, Instacomedy!
Drug addicts try to kill themselves, but they can't...
because of... I don't know, something, it's funny!
But I am appalled that you didn't credit the original video's creator.
I mean, the guy worked really hard to make a visual effect that has never, ever been done before.
[speaking Spanish]
Although he might've seen this popular Vine from 2014...
by Instagram megastar, Logan Paul...
who probably saw this video from 2013...
which is just a good version of this effect shot from an obscure 2009 web series, The Variants...
which could've been inspired by a scene in the 1999 comedy 'Bowfinger'...
which might've been doing a funny take on the disturbing accident shot...
in the 1998 drama 'Meet Joe Black'.
[speaking Spanish]
Dodging traffic is a visual effects meme because...
it can look impressive with relatively little work.
Whether you're coordinating an army of interweaving cars,
jumping out of the way of a speeding train or...
carrying out a highly inefficient cat rescue,
the steps are pretty much the same.
Set up a solid, stationary camera angle.
Film the action with no vehicles around,
then capture some vehicles passing by separately.
Mix and match both elements to taste using various common compositing techniques.
And finally, introduce some artificial camera shake to help the viral video medicine go down.
By following these five steps, I've created an epic traffic dodging video of my own.
But if I want it to go viral,
I better add the final touch.
Now, if I understand correctly,
the guy who made the highway video posted a followup, saying...
if you help him reach 777 subscribers,
he'll finally reveal the truth...
about whether the video is real or a hoax,
which is...
adorable!
So let's all help him out.
There. Subscribed.
In fact, I better click it again just to make sure it worked."

Captain Disillusion: Greetings children, it's me, Captain Disillusion and I-I-
Holly: -and I'm Holly, where this is, and always has been, my thing.
CD: I'm here to warn you to the universe itself, is an unreliable narrator.
H: Consider the mysterious phenomenon known as the ""Mandela Effect"",
H: when people inexplicably share identical memories of things that never happened.
CD: Remember the genie movie starring a black guy who isn't Shaquille O'Neal and the movie is not called ""Kazaam""?
H: Yeah!
CD: Well, it doesn't exist!
H: What?!
CD: Mandela Effect!
H: Hey, you know how the ""Kit-Kat"" logo is spelled with a dash?
CD: Of course, that's one of the main things that I know!
H: Wrong! There was never a dash!
CD: Aah!
H: Mandela Effect.
H: The term comes from the fact that many, many, many white people clearly recall that the South African revolutionary, Nelson Mandela,
H: dying in prison in the 80's instead as a free man in 2013.
CD: Examples are too numerous and consistent to be dismissed as simple misremembering of basic facts
CD: and no one is immune.
H: Have you ever quoted Hannibal Lecter saying, ""Hello, Clarice."" in Silence of the Lambs?
H: I'm sorry, but he never actually said that. Check the film.
CD: Do you picture C-3PO as all gold?
CD: I'm afraid his right leg has always been silver,
CD: except when they forgot about it in the prequels and made up a backstory later.
H: It appears you have been affected.
CD: But don't panic, the unthinkable hasn't happened,
CD: you, are not wrong.
CD: It's just that the entire universe around you, is the wrong universe.
H: At some point, you slipped out of a timestream where things are the way you remember,
H: and into this one, where things are different in tiny ways that don't impact history, but make you
H: just a little bit special.
CD: Either that, or it's a corporate cover-up, like when they retroactively changed the Berenstein Bears to the Berenstain Bears to make them sound less Jew-ish.
CD: I mean, come on, who has the name Berenstain?
CD: The authors of the books? Whatever!
H: Or how my eyes have retroactively changed to green in all previous Captain D videos to make me look more Irish.
CD: The reality of the Mandela Effect cannot be denied. It has an official website.
H: Countless blog articles.
CD: And a support group of sorts on the most welcoming platform on the internet, Reddit.
CD: They don't do that just for anything.
H: You're not alone, we're with you.
CD: And one sufferer to another, I make a humble request.
H: That you please.
CD: Please.
H: Just.
CD: Just.
CD: Stop it!
H: Stop it!
CD: Just stop already, this is dumb!
H: Enough with this crap already! Seriously!
CD: The Mandela Effect is not a medically recognized physiological phenomenon,
CD: it's from a blog started by a self-described ""paranormal consultant"", Fiona Broome.
CD: A name that fits nicely among Disney Afternoon's janitor based villains like,
CD: Winifred from Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers and Ammonia Pines from Dark Wing Duck.
CD: Her main gig is writing tips on ghost hunting for beginners, but in 2010, she stumbled on a new marketing opportunity.
H: She proposed a catchy name and a sexy paranormal hypotheses for an effect that has a much simpler explanation.
CD: Which it's that, we're not special.
CD: And our brains all fail at memory in the same predictable ways.
CD: We reconstruct memories each time we recall them and we're prone to adopting the recollection of others as our own.
H: Think of the thousands of unrelated commenters misspelling ""you're"" as ""your"" under this video.
CD: Or millennials quoting classic movie lines they only heard in SNL parodies which they only saw cause it was trending in their feed.
CD: To them, ""...Life is like a box of chocolates..."" and ""Luke, I am your father."" and ""Play it again, Sam"" are all things characters said.
H: It doesn't take an alternate universe or global conspiracy to accept that all these people arrived at the same incorrect notions independently.
CD: But when you google the fascinating mysterious Mandela Effect, 14 out of the 20 examples in the Buzzfeed article that comes up as the top hit,
CD: are all about tiny spelling errors and movie misquotes.
H: Froot Loops is written with two O's? Time to argue about the nature of reality in this comment thread!
CD: The other examples are all about similar visual minutiae, whenever cartoons characters had monocles or tails or spots on their tails.
CD: I wanna throw a refrigerator through a window.
H: And of course there are the obligatory Sazaam starring Sinbad and Nelson Mandela's death date examples that are totally not racist.
H: And people also remember Rodney King dying in 1993.
CD: And this is where Ammonia Pine-, I mean Fiona Broome, and anyone else who promotes a metaphysical explanation of the effect,
CD: roll their eyes.
H: Ugh.
H: You don't understand at all.
H: We're not saying we are definitely right.
H: Or that people don't make mistakes.
H: Or that things didn't happened the way history has recorded them, sweetie.
H: We just want you to be open to the possibility that,
H: something odd may or may not be going on.
H: It's just interesting to think about.
CD: Reacting to recent criticisms in the media, Winifred-, I mean Fiona, wrote,
CD: ""The Mandela Effect is quirky. It's weird. It's fun, if you step away from the topic and look at it intellectually.""
CD: ""This site has been based in, ""Okay, what if altenate memories are mostly accurate? What if alternate realities exist, and we can interact with them? Then what...?"" ""
H: Well, let's see.
H: If Nelson Mandela died in prison during the 1980's, then I guess he never became the first black democratically elected president of South Africa.
H: It's just interesting to think about.
CD: If the Berenstain Bears were secretly renamed for marketing purposes, then their creators Stan &amp; Jan Berenstain must have changed their name too.
CD: And maybe the Holocaust didn't happen in this timestream, I mean, who's to say?
CD: It's just interesting to think about.
H: If Shazaam starring Sinbad was the film everyone remembers, then the ""How did this get made?"" podcast never did an episode about Kazaam starring Shaq,
H: with TV writer Kay Cannon as a guest, causing her to fall down the stairs that day, having never completed the final draft of Pitch Perfect 3,
H: leaving out a pivotal scene that inspires Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, to believe in himself enough to greenlight presidential impeachment!
H: IT'S JUST INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT!
CD: See, there is only one reality, one kind of facts, without alternatives.
CD: Being fascinated with a quirk of the mind is great.
CD: But if your explanation for it blows right past Occam's Razor to inter-universe leakage,
CD: It's kinda a problem for the rest of us.
H: It encourages sloppy, uncritical thinking, which is never a good thing.
H: Knowing how to distinguish what you think is real from what is real, is the most important skill in the universe.
H: I'm saying that and I'm an actual goddess.
CD: By the way, in Holly's timestream, reddit has a different name.
CD: Instead of ""red"", it's blue and instead of ""it"", it's ""me"", because it's a forum for people who did that last nigh-
H: He's joking. He's actually very grateful, but a personality disorder prevents him from expressing genuine affection.
CD: You wish, you...terrible enemy...whom I hate!
H: And for the term Mandela Effect, just keep in mind.
CD: When you popularize it, the only thing you accomplish is helping this woman, use this website to sell this shirt.
CD: But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids.
H: But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids.
CD: A substitute school teacher in Scranton refuses to cover a chapter in evolution.
H: An attorney in Memphis wants a recovered memory admitted as evidence in court.
CD: Remember to love with your heart, use your head for ever- Aah!

Greetings, children. It's me.
Captain Disillusion.
And I'm starting to feel like
I'm not getting through to you again.
Because, I mean,
I thoroughly explained
a floating city video a year ago.
Now, another one comes out,
and you ask me
to explain it again.
I do a rant about the importance
of knowing when videos are real,
and you request for the hundredth time
that I debunk the Apollo moon landings.
I present a reasoned
series of arguments
for why the Cicret bracelet
is not worth your money,
and you donate
four million dollars
to a ""Laser Razor"" Kickstarter.
And when Kickstarter shuts it down,
you still give them half a
million dollars on Indiegogo.
It's as if you like hoaxes.
You don't care about
telling real from fake, do you?
You just want in on the game.
You'd be happy if I just
sat here and taught you
how to create
a hoax of your own.
Is that what you want?
A tutorial?
Well, I'll give you a tutorial.
(ACTION MUSIC)
Hey, what's up.
Captain D. here for
ufocopilot.biz,
and welcome back to another
exciting paranormal hoax tutorial.
Today, we're gonna be
taking a look at creating
an interdimensional
vortex portal in the sky
complete with a UFO going into it.
Just like this one
captured in Geneva
in the area of the
Large Hadron Collider.
All I can say is wow.
Now, in the conspiracy
theory community,
There's been a lot
of conCERN lately…
Get it?
con…CERN?
About the dangerous
clandestine experiments.
that physicists are conducting
with the LHC at CERN.
The problem is -- to really
understand what they're up to,
I would have to read all this stuff.
Or at least listen to credible science 
communicators like Neil deGrasse Tyson.
But it's kind of hard
to take them seriously
when they get regularly
schooled at press conferences
by bloggers like Anthony Liversidge,
who understand science on my level.
Because at the end of the day,
who are you gonna believe?
An internationally-monitored,
publicly-funded organization
that's been around for 63 years?
Or…Science Guardian Blog?
Home of conspiracy
theories, HIV AIDS denialism,
and the anti-vax movement.
I don't know about you, but just
from a pure aesthetic standpoint,
I gotta go with Science Guardian.
Look, the site even has
state-of-the-art responsive design.
Look at that.
Alright, let's go and get started.
I've got these two clips of footage,
and if I drag them into a new comp,
we can see that it's an angle of the sky
filmed as a time lapse,
and then the same angle
at normal speed.
Now, the time lapse if pretty cool,
but it's not paranormal enough.
So, I'm gonna duplicate
the clip and reverse it.
Let's add a rectangular
mask to the top of the sky,
feather it a bit, and set
the mode to subtract
so that now our clouds look
like they're moving in a weird
circular pattern.
Alright, I'll pre-compose this,
and call it ""Clouds — WEIRD.""
Now the actual
vortex in this video,
which I'm sure is real,
was captioned by a
channel called ""Section 51.""
I actually made a video about
a different Section 51 UFO sighting
in the past,
and they tried to
have it taken down.
But when you do that, you have
to provide detailed contact information,
and of all the things the
guy could've called himself
in relation to that video,
he chose the term, ""Auteur.""
Auteur.
I was a little bit confused
at first, but then…
I realized I can look it up.
And it's a French word whose
use is at an all-time high right now,
and it means ""author,"" or an
artist behind a creative work.
Now, does that mean
that all Section 51 videos
are in fact creative works,
and not documentary footage
of real phenomena?
The answer is…
we'll never know for sure,
so we should probably
keep an open mind.
But that e-mail was actually just YouTube telling me
""Dude, don't even worry about it, you're fine.""
""We're not taking the video down.""
""Section 51 are full of merde.""
Alright, let's create a new square solid and call it 'Vortex'
I'll go ahead and add a fractal noise effect to the solid,
bump up the contrast and the complexity a little,
and on the first frame of the clip I'll scale the noise up.
Add a key frame, and on the last frame, scale it down, so that over time,
our noise gradually shrinks.
Great. Now let's make some room, and add a distort twirl effect.
Which will give us that vortex shape.
I'll expand the radius a little.
And turn it counterclockwise because all UFO vortices are counterclockwise.
Now already that looks pretty good, except for the center.
So let's add a liquefy effect.
And use the pinch brush
To tap a few times in the middle.
And make it really pucker up.
And now it looks like a proper vortex that could suck up a UFO
Or more.
By the way, if you're wondering about this toolbar I'm using
It's a free plugin from a website called videocopilot.net
Here it is, the FX Console.
And the site's okay, but I'm a little uncomfortable with how obvious it is that they completely copied our site
And our business model.
I mean, c'mon guys, come up with your own thing.
I'm willing to let it go on for now, but my legal team tells me this is,
""Actionable.""
Alright, let's add a rectangle mask to the vortex, shrink it vertically, F to feather it out a bit,
and then we'll stretch it to the width of the comp.
I'll change the layer's transfer mode to Screen
Make it 3D layer, and then go ahead and rotate it and position it
in a way that makes sense in the shot.
I'll also animate the scale and the shape of the mask,
to make it look like it's closing up over time.
Now the vortex is still on top of everything, so let's go ahead and duplicate the background layer,
and add a linear color key effect that will let us key out the sky like a blue screen.
Now let's create the UFO.
I'll add a new black solid, make it comp size
And I'll use another videocopilot plugin called optical flares
Now this one's pretty good too, it lets
you create all kinds of lens flares and
they have many good-looking presets and
you can even create your own custom presets
""Eh, what're you looking at motherf--""
Sorry about that. We'll just keep it simple.
Choose this multi-iris element and press OK.
I'll bring it to the center, blur it out
change the transfer mode to add, and then animate the scale and position of the layer,
to make it move from a cloud, into the center of the vortex.
It might not look like much now, but the right sound effects,
[toilet flushing]
....will make all the difference.
I'll add some opacity key frames to the UFO and the vortex layers to make them fade out at the end.
For the second part of our shot, I'll take the non-time-lapse clip,
and try to animate its position, so that it sort of,
lands in the right spot as it settles down.
And that way, we have a seamless transition,
from a vortex sky to a normal-looking sky.
And I know everything looks fake, because we still haven't added the secret ingredient.
Let's pre-comp everything, and add a wiggle expression to the position property,
to make the layer shake randomly like a handheld camera.
We'll copy the expression, paste it into the rotation property
and divide it by 12 to make everything even more shaky.
As if the person filming has some sort of a disorder.
Now I'll go ahead and add some hand key frames on the position in the scale properties,
to make it look like the camera's zooming in and out.
Because even in this age of mobile devices
UFO sightings are still traditionally captured on camcorders with zoom controls.
Of course I'll blur everything, and go through and add a whole bunch of key frames
to imitate auto-focus fluctuations, circa 1985
And finally, let's do some color correction.
I'll add a curves adjustment, take down the red a bit,
maybe bring up the blue.
And then I'll add a tint effect to tone things down.
And then I'll add a CC composite effect
To fade everything back to how it was,
because it looked just fine.
So there you have it, a completely true to life,
inter-dimensional, portal, vortex
that you can upload to YouTube and get a couple of million views guaranteed.

Okay, learning is kind of fun.
We just have to remember to use our newly acquired powers for good
and not stupid.
Visual effects shouldn't be wasted on hoaxes,
They are after all, an elevated art form for telling stories,
and forcing deceased actors to fulfill their contracts posthumously.

Hey Kids.
As you know I recently contributed $250
to a startup's crowd-funding campaign
to develop an exciting new gadget called The Cicret Bracelet
which will make it possible to project
a video display from a device on your arm
on to your arm.
The timeline on their website said that
the bracelet would start shipping
to folks who contributed $250
by the end of 2016.
So, naturally, many, many, many of you
have been asking whether I received mine.
Well, the short answer is:
not yet.
But that's okay,
You see, right after I sent my pledge
the timeline on the website was adjusted
to say that shipping is expected to start by early 2017
and now the timeline's been removed completely because
look, developing a revolutionary new product
is hard and we all need to be patient at
least the Cicret team are keeping us
informed
I haven't received any email
communication but shortly after my video
about the Cicret bracelet came out the
company started posting weekly blog
updates about their progress in the 16
weeks since then they've made seven of
them but I've learned a lot the
developing prototype is looking better
and better and not at all like a regular
pico-projector stuck in a wristband
they seem to have switched from laser
projection back to LED I want to ask
them if that means the focus, keystone
correction, brightness, and on camera
flickr issues don't need to be worked
out but I can't because comments on all
the updates and the newest prototype
video are disabled
according to another weekly update
Cicret won a prize as one of the most
innovative startups from credit union or
something
I was excited and looked for more details
but there doesn't seem to be any
information about Cicret or the
competition on that corporations website
or the rest of the internet I guess I
can always find out more infos at
contact@cn2p.eu. Oh.
One touching weekly update was
from the Bosch Connected World
Conference where Cicret's founder Guillaume Pommier
a shared a story of an email from a
mother of an autistic child. (Guilluame speaking): on whether
autist correct english but it's difficult
autistic yes (CD): she can only communicate
with her son to an iPad but she can't
use it when he's in the shower and hopes
the Cicret bracelet to be a solution I
think that would be a great use for a
device like this and I'm glad the Cicret
team is confident their bracelet will
work as well in water as a dozen
sunlight and on dark skin but until
it actually exists in the hands of
consumers I would urge that mother to
seek out one of many available
waterproof iPad cases priced
substantially lower than the Cicret
bracelet is projected to cost
don't get me wrong I still believe in
this product and in the smartness of my
250 dollar investment but I just wanted
to know what it feels like so I caved
and got a knockoff bracelet on the dark web
It's called the Mistaque and uses a
2 petawatt integrated all gas-phase iodine
laser so no inverse-square problems for us
now let's see what this baby can do
I guess the world's not ready for the
Mistaque
Oh! I almost forgot about the most
important update from the Cicret team
they stop soliciting money from ordinary
people i don't know if 128.2 percent
of $500,000 was the magic number or if a
bit of fresh attention to the campaign
made them rethink their crowd funding
strategy but from now on
clicking the still present donate link
on their website won't cause thousands
of people to accidentally invest in a
product whose viability seems as much of
a stretch as its delivery date and
that's got to be worth 250 bucks
remember love with your heart
use your head for everything else"

(Drum roll)
Greetings children, Captain Disillusion here and,
boy, do I have a fun topic for you today!
Some might think this one's for the birds,
but when it comes to the world's largest living bird, I say we better catch the early worm!
(Laugh)
Check out this insane video of ostriches skiing the slopes like pros!
What?
My mind is getting blown harder and harder with every inrun, every takeoff and every knoll!
How'd they do it?
(Smash)
I'm pretty sure ostriches can't be trained to ski.
But even if they could, why would a ski resort let you put one on a ski lift?
Let alone endanger... (Fades out)
(Piano music in background) Man, YouTube used to be cool...
Seriously, when those three guys started YouTube in their garage in 2005,
it was about something real.
Then Google bought it, whenever that was, and has just been running it into the ground ever since...
It's like, stop making improvements that make this the best video sharing platform in the world
and focus on what really matters.
Ensuring that every single subscriber sees every single thing I post, every single time!
Is that so much to ask?
I mean, just because people now subscribe to hundreds and hundreds of channels
doesn't mean we need to employ some sort of
""algorithm"" to curate the avalanche of content in their massive subscription feeds...
And we should definitely not give them the option of overriding this algorithim with a single button.
Oh, I hate that bell so much!
(Fades in) -that video absolutely must be fake but,
to figure out exactly what we're dealing with,
our first question should be:
""Just, where does this video come from?""
It's actually one of several promotional spots created for
a campaign called ""Japan Snow Project"".
In an attempt to revive the country's dwindling snow leisure market in 2004,
the three major transportation carriers responsible for access to ski resorts
(Japan Railway East, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways)
teamed up to sponsor this light-hearted series of ads,
which borrowed the already popular ostrich character from the previous year's campaign by JR-EAST.
The videos were produced by the Tokyo-based creative agency ""Tugboat""
and filmed by the Tohokushinnsha Film Corporation under the supervision of Hideyuki Tanaka,
an art director with a strong background in... CGI character animation.
Now, it's easy to just file this under ""it's CGI"" and move on to the next viral video
but that kind of attitude doesn't really help us become more... (Fades out)
The thing that no-one seems to understand, because they don't know about
the button I have that shows all the charts,
is that the videos of some of my fellow content creators
are being recommended less and less.
It's that damned algorithm!
What else could it be?
It's the only thing that's been changing recently
according to... well, not YouTube but,
anecdotal evidence from my fellow content creators.
I know what hasn't been changing.
Our viewers.
Good old, unchangeable, predictable, simple-minded YouTube viewers.
They don't have the capacity to grow, to evolve their tastes towards something objectively better and
reshape the trends of media consumption.
So they certainly don't need to be included as a variable in my complicated theory
about how the youtube algorithim is designed to [BLEEP] over me and my fellow content creators!
(Fades in) ...and of ourselves.
So, were these ads possible to make with the limited visual effects technology of 2004?
Well, that wasn't exactly the stone age.
Harry Potter 3, Spiderman 2, The Day After Tomorrow, The Aviator, Hellboy, Alien vs. Predator.
All came out in 2004
and all employed some form of placing CG models into live action environments.
Also, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.
Japan Snow Project, which ironically may have been filmed in New Zealand,
relied heavily on a visual effects technique known as
""Rig Removal"".
It's an entire specialty in the craft of digital compositing.
Erasing props, structures and people from live action shots.
It can be as simple as covering up things that have been filmed at a stationary angle
with unobstructed moments in the footage,
or as complex as building a 3D replica of the environment and handpainting
missing background details.
After filming real skiers perform, maticulous rig removal was the
first step in the Snow Project visual effects process.
With clean background plates the filmmakers could now, theoretically,
put some other computer generated character in the stunt performers place!
But in order to animate this new character in a realistic way,
they first needed to re-create the motions of the camera and the performers in 3D.
To do that, they used motion... (Fades out)
My fellow content creators are being slightly affected by a temporary problem
and I need to take action!
I should complain...
...to my viewers about this very relatable problem.
Maybe a dramatic threat to delete my channel when I reach 300,000 subscribers?
Which, because of my reputation for being goofy and ironic with my viewers,
the rest of the world will totally understand as a joke.
That's it, as soon as I'm done here, I'll make the video that finally-
What the-?
Someone beat me to it!
Who is this ""Pew Die Pie""?
And where does he get off?
50 million subscribers?
Oh, boo hoo, cry me a river.
Here's what I think about your millionaire problems!
(Fades in) ...point, the exact camera angles and lighting are locked in
freeing the artists to focus on animation.
But even so,
these ""animated"" ostriches are just a little too real, aren't they?
How did a small tourism promo achieve such natural feather simulations,
when even the most groundbreaking feature films of the same year
struggled to realistically depict that type of overlapping action?
The answer might be hidden in plain sight.
Intercut with the hero shots of the ostriches doing stunts,
are cutaways of them casually hanging out with other skiers.
In this group shot, a person convincingly pats the ostrich's body.
This very brief angle at a picnic table shows complex shadows
from the ostrich's torso and wings falling on nearby objects.
This would be extremely difficult to fake and unnecessary for such a throwaway moment.
And in this scene of the ostrich trying to fit through the ski lift gate,
he visibly pushes the railing,
the feathers interact with it
and the tail realistically bumps into the person behind.
And finally, a small imperfection,
perhaps the only imperfection in the entire series,
is visible.
Part of the shaking railing below
remains frozen.
It's a rig removal patch, hiding what was really there.
But why would only the area below the torso be hidden?
Unless this ostrich torso, with it's flapping wings and complex feathers,
is really there.
You know, like a puppet!
Or a realistic partial costume, perhaps
custom-made by one of a number of
special effects makeup companies
specializing in animal anatomy.
Come to think of it, real ostriches are a bit bigger than they appear in these ads.
But the torsos of these would seem to fit nicely on the shoulder area of a human performer.
And help the geometry of what happens in many of these shots make a lot more sense.
With this major visually complex part of the character taken care of in the photography,
the rig removers only need to worry about erasing the performer's limbs,
the match movers have a nice, large object on which to track and solve the motion
and the animators only need to add solid-textured heads and legs to the image.
Which is exactly what they did after
capturing detailed reference images of a real ostrich in a studio
and using them to texture an animated 3D model.
Hey, I never said it was easy.
But as usual, the most convincing effects came from combining the practical
and the digital.
As viewers, we might be familiar with any one technique... (Fades out)
Oh, looks like I'm not the only one poking fun at that guy.
Some people are being unreasonable though...
Whoa, okay, that article just called him straight-up racist.
That's over the line.
I'm starting to rethink my tweet.
And now my recent inexplicable influx of gamer fans
are turning on me.
Perfect.
I hope they never find out the only video games I've ever played are
Sonic the Hedgehog, Mortal Kombat, Back to the Future and Portal 2
When will this year be over?
In the end, these ostrich clips accomplish what
few viral ads and no OK Go videos other that first one managed to do.
Impress me.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go, kids.
Remember, love with your heart,
use your head for everything else.
Captain Disillusion!
Whoa, girl, whoa!
Hi ho, catchico,  Away!
(Laugh)
Maybe beating the YouTube algorithm isn't up to me.
And if I just keep making stuff,
to the best of my ability,
at a pace I'm comfortable with,
my audience will seek me out against all odds.
And enjoy every silly moment because
it's just binary data.
On a website owned by a company
based in a country on a continent of a small planet.
It could all be gone...
Like that.

When are you gonna get it?
Nothing you've ever seen is original.
Pop-culture is a neverending game...
...of musical chairs.
What was once in books...
...is now in comics.
What was in comics is in movies.
What was movies is TV.
TV is games.
And WHITE IS THE NEW ASIAN!
Everything is a thing from before, just a little different.
Except for this channel...
...which is COMPLETELY ORIGINAL.
So when you see a new viral video...
...of a wise old man
demonstrating a magical feat of telekinesis....
...consider that you might just be looking
at the oldest trick in the book.
So old, I covered it in my pre-Internet days!
*rocking VHS intro plays*
*magical hand wave *
Invisible thread is an extremely thin nylon filament.
And a delicious way
to WOW up your conjuring to the next level.
You can pick up a reel of invisible thread...
...from your local magic shop.
I stripped my own from this pair of black pantyhose...
...generously donated by my grandmother.
*rocking transition*
The key to an effective levitation
is the rigging of the thread.
You don't wanna just dangling your object...
...from above like a cat toy.
*meow*
What if instead...
...we attached one end of the thread to our body...
...and the other to a nearby structure...
...like a wall or another structure.
*magical card&amp;silk vomiting*
Allow me to SHOELACEtrate.
One end goes on my lapel...
...and the other...
...on this cardboard cut-out of Ang Lee's latest triumph...
...Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.
A bit of magician's wax...
...and not the kind I use to stay dolphin-smooth...
...is enough to attach the item I want to levitate...
...to the thread.
*fiery transition*
And now, for the moment of truth!
Or should I say...
...MAGIC.
Suspending the object from 2 points...
...reduces the dangling motion.
I can make it float higher or lower...
...by subtly moving my body in and out.
And I can even wave my hands around the cup...
...in a tubular fashion.
TUBULAR!
*not awkward demonstration*
*slightly more awkward demonstration*
*a bit too awkward demonstration*
Alas...
...the age of magic trick training tapes is long over.
Today we care about
real world unscripted human drama.
Like a guy about to be hit by a train...
...getting heroically rescued by a railworker
in this brand new video.
It's mute.
It's choppy.
And it's a terrible composite...
...of a train with no shadow...
...but whether or not it's fake...
...at least it's new, right?
Well, let me tell you a story...
...about a young man...
...a student...
...in the art of cinematographic storytelling...
...at the turn of the century.
The 21st century.
In exchange for a degree...
...of questionable legitimacy...
...from a college that no longer exists.
He directed a supernaturally themed short film...
...about troubled teens channeling their frustration...
...into writing in a special class.
And the climax of the story...
...the evil bad guy...
...is gruesomely dispatched by a train.
(...) Spoiler alert!
The young filmmaker's effort earned him and his crew...
...the coveted ""Best Thesis Film"" trophy at his school.
It was made of acrylic, didn't have his name on it...
...and it would be the ONLY award he'd receive...
...for the 15 years...
...until a subsidiary of a search engine company
would send him...
...a plaque also without his real name on it.
But it inflated his ego enough...
...to think that his friends would enjoy
a ""special edition"" of his college film.
A version with director's commentary....
...behind the scenes footage...
...and breakdowns of his groundbreaking visual effects.
Thankfully...
...his cartoonish arrogance back then...
...will save me a little bit of editing work today.
First...
...a static shot is composed...
...and the camera is locked off securely.
The human action is filmed...
...safely, without a train.
Then...
...all the actors and crew vacate the area...
...and the passing of a REAL train is captured...
...at the same angle.
The two shots are timed against each other...
...to depict the near miss or a hit...
...and composited together...
...as seamlessly as the rototools,
patience and talent allow.
Of course...
...it's the little things that make a shot special.
Will the angle work...
...for revealing a character
on the other side of the tracks...
...after the train has passed?
Or will you have to digitally shorten your train...
...to just 4 cars...
...to accomodate a clueless actor...
...who runs accross the tracks WAY TOO EARLY.
Will this visual effect be viewed...
...in the context of a dramatic scene...
...in a well written narrative...
...that only a handful of people will ever see?
Or will it be a pointless, artless youtube hoax...
...that's destined to go viral.
In other words...
...is it better to fail in originality...
...then to succeed in imitation?
Wait...
Herman Melville said that.
Damn it!
Can't I have ONE ORIGINAL THOUGHT?
*woosh*

"
Greetings, children! How you like me now eh?
I've Gynééfied myself with
my disruptive new invention, the Gynéé!
It uses advanced ""kortdramanometry"", to fit
you into a tiny container, so you can
ship yourself instead of paying for
today's overpriced, factory farm plane tickets.
Now, it will be nuclear-powered,
so... shipping costs may in some cases
exceed the price of a plane ticket.
But here's what you need to know, pledging
two hundred and fifty dollars and above
gets you listed in the credits of a
documentary I'm making about me
inventing the Gynéé. And yeah! There's no
prototype yet the device is still in the
fake CGI viral video stage of
development, but guess what!
So we're some of the greatest future
inventions of the 21st, century! Like the
Cecret bracelet. Chances are you've come
across this video from 2014 of a
seemingly brilliant product concept.
a bracelet that turns your wrist into a mobile screen.
Like my Gynéé demo, the video
is completely fake, of course.
It's just a prop bracelet with pictures of
phone interfaces composited and tracked
on to the arms, poorly. The screen slides
around, and appears too sharp and opaque
compared to the rest of the image, but
unlike the Gynéé, the Cicret Bracelet has
quietly gathered over half a million
dollars in crowdfunding from actual
members of the same species as you!
Newscaster 1: ""People will want that.""
Newscaster 2: ""I think of football... quarterback!""
NC 1: ""There you go! That's actually a good idea.""
Captain D: Now, you know me.
I'm not one to judge people getting rewarded
for putting crazy things on the internet.
[glass crashing sound]
If, like me, these visionary self-starters
want your help funding a great new invention,
Who am I to complain? But is it a great
invention? Is it even possible for it to
work as originally advertised? Let's take
a closer look.
The makers are adamant that they haven't
invented any new technology, but rather
combined existing tech into unique
combination to improve a product.
That product: the video display! What began as
a primitive box with a light source
projecting low quality pictures onto a
matte surface, has been developed for
over a century into a high resolution,
self-illuminating, interactive panel so
thin and light, it's easily integrated
into powerful mobile devices we can take
with us wherever we go. And now the
developers of the Cicret Bracelet
want to take the next logical step,
detaching the image from the mobile
device, lowering its quality, and using a
box with a light source to project it
onto a matte surface.
Please indulge me
as I go through a brief list of
potential problems with that approach.. *Clears Throat*
Number one: projectors aren't magic.
Their performance depends on external
conditions, like a dark environment and a
bright, neutral projection surface.
A projected pictures shadows could only
look as dark as the surface looks on its
own, and the pictures highlights could
only look as bright as the surface looks
under the full illumination of the
projectors beam. Even a 24 kilowatt
Purnell couldn't cast a decent image onto a
sheet of black velvet at high noon in
the Sahara desert. How's a tiny light
source gonna fare on a sunny Miami day
projected onto the arm of my black son?
About that well. And he's fine, by the way.
He's spending this millennium with his
mother as per our ""agreement"". Also the
color of the surface effects the hues in
the projected image. That's why cinema
screens are white, so if you've already
pre-ordered your Cicret Bracelet, find a
color gel that matches your skin tone,
and glue it to your phone's display to
start getting used to how it's going to look.
Number Two -
short-throw anamorphic projection is
the worst kind of projection.
Remember that thing I explained that time?
Imagine the exact opposite: instead of viewing a
stretched out picture at an angle, we
have a straight view of a highly
squeezed picture beamed from an angle
which re-stretches it back to normal
dimensions. Most of the pixels are
dedicated to resolving the top of the
image. By the time you get to the bottom,
its defined by just a handful of
stretchy squares. And speaking of squares
with any ordinary light source like an
LED at such a small scale there's a
noticeable light fall-off between the
close and far end of the projection due
to something physicists and I like to
call, the inverse-square law. So spray
some dark paint at the bottom of your
phone screen to update our simulation.
Wait, this just in, I'm being told now the
secret team travelled into the future,
saw my video, and adjusted their strategy.
According to this footage of their
presentation at the wearable
technologies conference this year, they
will not be using an LED projector.
They're going with a laser projector
solution.
Lasers shine highly directional
light for very long distances, so say
goodbye to the inverse square law issue.
But say hello with your eyes and skin, to
potentially hazardous laser radiation
exposure! Purchase a laser emitter.
There's always a big yellow warning
sticker advising you not to shine it on
living tissue.
So go ahead peel that off and paste it
onto our simulation, and then throw the
whole thing in the garbage because
several major electronics manufacturers
have already tried to introduce
full-color laser projection technology
to the consumer market and failed.
Number Three - Cicret's method for touch
sensing doesn't make much sense. The plan
is to use proximity sensors the same
devices, that make self-activating
faucets possible. They work by projecting
a beam, usually infrared, and sensing when
it gets reflected by physical objects.
Sounds reasonable, for simple button
presses. This virtual keyboard, which uses
laser projection and an infrared
proximity sensor to detect keystrokes,
has been on the market for years, and it
works... great? But what about multi-touch
gestures? With all the sensors on one
side won't some fingers block others
from being seen, rendering rotation
zooming, and pinching possibly impossible?
Which brings me to the design
of the bracelet itself. It's sleek, it's
modern, it's the kind of thing Steve Jobs
would have loved to have been buried
wearing, but how can all this amazing
functionality fit in such a small
package? Let's take another,
even closer look.
Ignoring the madness that is this
diagram in the original video showing a
processor, accelerometer, card reader,
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, an
indicator light, a vibration motor, a
projector, and eight proximity sensors
all powered by a battery the size of a
pumpkin seed located at the farthest
possible point from the recharging port.
Let's just look at the bracelets
aesthetics. The design that may have
inspired you to throw your financial
support behind the company, looked like
this tiny evenly spaced pinholes
breaking up an otherwise seamless
Karim Rashid style color turdlet, but
now that you've invested this is the
latest iteration of what it might look
like. A vertical projector and sensor
assembly seated atop the bracelet
seemingly thicker than the Apple watch,
than any watch really! And there's something
familiar about this sensor arrangement...
[foghorn blows]
Incidentally... [spoken to delivery person] Disillusioned
the first prototype of my Gynéé device has just arrived!
[glamorous music begins]
[cartoon whizzing sound, comical bonk sound]
[wheezing] It works!
Keep in mind, even this image of the
Cicret Bracelet is still a mock-up. We
haven't seen a working prototype. What we
have seen is a video posted in February 2015,
called Cicret Bracelet first working
prototype. It's a series of shots showing
disappointingly faint, blurry, and
distorted projections cast onto some
exquisitely hairless forearms.
A title card claiming the device works on every
skin tone precedes a shot of an arm
filmed in such deep shadow, it's
impossible to tell what the skin tone
actually is. Another card saying it works
in ""bright daylight"" precedes two shots
filmed and rather... overcast conditions.
Which I almost didn't notice, because
I was too distracted by the insane flicker
present throughout the demo. But don't
worry! The flicker is merely an artifact
of the camera shutter, it's not visible
in real life. I'd like to take a moment
to discuss competence. Not high level
technical expertise, or intellectual
brilliance, just basic human competence
we all strive for in our daily lives.
Now, if you were making a proof-of-concept
video for your invention, and a simple
camera issue was causing that very
concept to look HORRIBLE, and all you had
to do to fix it is to adjust one setting,
wouldn't you move heaven and earth to
try to figure out how to do it?
Better yet, wouldn't you try to design your
device not to have this issue at all?
When the Cicret bracelet hits the market,
many customers will film theirs in
action, and put it online exhibiting the
same flickering which may result in
[in slowed down distorted voice]
negative brand perception
Which flickery laser projector did they end up fitting
inside their prototype anyway? Wait a
minute! That might not be a laser
projector at all! There's a pretty
obvious light fall-off, and we're never
even shown the full device in any of these shots!
Could it be that they simply strapped an
off-the-shelf pico projector to a hand
like I did earlier with my son?
GIVE ME BACK MY SON! You know, it's funny. If I
said that this image used to advertise
the Cicret Bracelet is a bold-faced lie,
because it's impossible for a light
projection to be darker than the surface
on which is being projected, I could get
in legal trouble. But on the other hand,
the inventors of the Cicret Bracelet
have been fine collecting money based on
promises of images like this, without
putting a single disclaimer on any of
them! Just who are these shrewd genius
entrepreneurs? [comical honk sound]
Let's see, there's non-threatening Drew Carey,
Picasso Johnny Depp, and at the helm a
father-and-son team of Pascal and Guillaume
Pommier. I think they're father and son?
There's really not that much information
out there about them. Pascal has
experience in IT and management, and Guillaume
is a salesman, a very tenacious one. Ever
wonder why the bracelet is called Cicret?
Well, because the name is borrowed from
Guillaume previous venture.
This was his IndieGoGo campaign to raise
$50,000 for Cicret, the secure messaging
app. It managed to raise $15 from one
anonymous backer, you can still download
the app from the Google Play Store.
Try it and let me know how well it works. It
was then that Guillaum pivoted to the
bracelet idea, and started another
IndieGoGo campaign, this time for
$500,000. It topped out at thirteen
hundred fifty seven, or as IndieGoGo puts
it zero percent of the goal, before he
closed it and disguised the campaign's
name. Why was it so tough? Well you see,
reputable crowdfunding platforms like
Patreon, Kickstarter, and IndieGoGo
protect donors by requiring creators to
meet their own benchmarks and deliver
rewards in a timely fashion,
something Guillaum struggled with from the
start. Luckily, there was a better, less
accountable solution.
He abandoned IndieGoGo, and switched to
collecting donations directly from
credit cards, first via PayPal, and now
via Stripe. In less than two years,  he not
only reached the $500,000 goal, but
surpassed it by 20%! Turns out not all of
that came from online donors, but still
it's a lesson to us all.
By not having to deal with a fundraising sites
consumer protecting rules, Guillaum is able to
make all kinds of promises and
projections on Cicret's own website. A
site he fully controls, a site whose news
section chronicles two years of the
company's activity in just nine posts.
One of which is a poll, and another a
thank you for participating in the poll.
A site where your generous upfront
contributions for a currently
non-existent product are collected under
a strict ""no refunds"" policy.
Sometimes I'm accused of being overly...
cynical and... asshole-istic, but I don't want
to be seen that way! I'd be thrilled if
Bigfoot hunters, psychic healers, and
wearable technology innovators were
proven right! And I would gladly
sacrifice the funding of my
revolutionary Gynéé storage container
system, we pivoted, if it would help the
Cicret Bracelet deliver on its promises.
In fact I have! Guillaum, if you're listening, I
saw the limited time offer on your
website, and I decided to participate.
Prior to the deadline, I contributed the
maximum two hundred and fifty dollar
donation of my own money to your cause,
which I believe entitles me to a free
secret bracelet by no later than the end
of 2016,
according to your own timeline. I'm
excited, and you should be too because, if
the bracelet I receive functions exactly
like your 2014 video depicts. I promise,
in front of these two hundred thousand
witnesses that I'll ditch this old thing,
start wearing this Cicret as my
whimsical communicator device, and put a
purchase link to it in the first video.
I'm a fan of you Guillaum! I'm an
investor! And I just can't wait.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to
go kids, a police detective in Illinois
is about to ask a psychic for help with
a missing-persons case for the third
time. Remember: love with your heart. Use
your head for everything else.

CD: It's harder to prank kids though,
CD: because their wavers have to be signed by guardians who are vigilant about their well-being. Pft.
CD: But children do tend to provoke a strong emotional response in most people, which guarantees views.
CD: Mmm...
CD: Well, there's no law against using kids to prank other adults!
CD: Or the audience.
CD: So for years, we've been dressing girls as unreal ghosts to traumatize people in hotels.
CD: And employing visual effects to stage fatal accidents as bizarre viral ads for...
CD: German dinner theater.

You guys like optical illusions?
Here's one you might be familiar with.
It's called...
The Thatcher Effect
Upside down this looks like a perfectly normal photo...
...of the Spectics Guide to the Universe
podcast co-host...
...Jay Novella.
But if we turn it right side up...
...eeeeeurrhg.
Right?!
Other optical illusions can be quite elegant.
For instance, the...
...Ambiguous Cylinder, Rectangle and Circles illusion...
By Kokichi Sugihara
I couldn't get clearance
for the accompanying music...
...by Yoko Sugihara...
...so I'm going to approximate it
with my own original composition.
*hits keyboard ever so gently*
The video shows various round cylinders...
...reflecting in the mirror
as square cylinders and vice versa...
...in different combinations.
Seems like it could not have been done
without some sort of visual effect.
But amazingly...
...it was!
This IS just a mirror...
...and everything was captured by the camera...
...as it appears.
How was it done?!
Well...
A busy little 3D-printing beaver...
...was quick to demonstrate...
...the basic technique.
So very, VERY quick.
But some questions still remain unanswered...
Like... how was this piece done?
And why are 3D-printers still so terrible
at the thing they're designed for?
So let's figure out exactly how the illusion works...
...and explain each object featured in the video...
...using nothing more, than...
...STATE OF THE ART COMPUTER GRAPHICS.
Here's a flat square. ■
We can depict it rotating 3 dimensionally
in a 2D video with PERSPECTIVE CUES.
But these cues are ambiguous.
You might be looking at a square straight on...
...OR a trapezoid at an angle.
In 2D there's no way to know for sure.
By using an object's shape to counteract perspective...
...we can secretly encode
a completely different shape...
...in the same object.
The ambiguous cylinder is ambiguous
because it's neither round, nor square.
It's halfway inbetween.
And it can be nudged to one extreme or the other...
...by the perspective of the angle from which it's viewed.
We have to decide on this angle before
we can modify the cylinder's top and bottom...
...to make the illusion work.
Let's use 45 degrees looking down.
Just like in the video.
The mirror reflection is the same 45 degree angle
from the opposite side.
To make the cylinder look more round from this view...
...we need to flatten the top and bottom corners...
...while streching the side corners vertically.
Coincidentally...
...to make it look more square from here...
...we need to pinch the side corners...
...while streching out the top and bottom.
Both adjustments can be made simultaneously...
...by distorting the edge vertically
into an S shaped curve...
...tuned precisely for our viewing angle...
...but without rotating the edge surface.
We also have to tweak
the sharpness of the vertical corners...
...for the focal length of our camera's lens.
The kind of technical detail...
...that some ""make-anything"" PUNK...
...WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT!
Okay... 
(offscreen) CAPTAIN!
WHAT?!
WHAT?!
I... these kids...
They put things up over night
and then get 3 million views!
And I'm sitting on my...
The resulting effect is flawless.
As long as we light the object softly
to get rid of telltale shadows...
...and keep the viewing angle exactly the same.
Changing the camera's position...
...or even the lens' field of view...
...would cause the effect to break down.
All the different shapes featured in the video...
...are variations of the same initial object.
The six adjacent cylinders...
...are six adjacent cylinders.
The four intersecting cylinders...
...intersect at slightly varying heights...
...making it possible to hide the intersection
on the square side.
The 12 nested cylinders...
...have the inner ones reversed...
...and connected to flat bridges at appropiate angles.
And the 2 disconnected cylinders...
...are actually attached at an offset height...
...and use a false corner piece...
...to make it seem like
they're intersecting on the square side.
Together they make up a masterful illusion...
...worthy of the 2016 ""Best Illusion of the Year Prize"".
Or is it ""Illusion of the Year""?
Correlate your neurons Neaural Correlate Society!
Ahhh...
Isn't it nice to understand something SO THROUGHLY...
...that you're sick of it, and never want to see it again?
Now about the spinning dancer illusion...
Before we debate
which direction she's really spinning in...
...let's agree on ONE thing...
...THAT'S NOT A DANCE MOVE.
Okay?!
She's falling over while bouncing on her heel.
What kind of dance is that?!

Greetings children, it's me, Captain Disillusion. Thank you for all your excellent video suggestions.
It's great how you and I are on the same wavelength. We get it,
unlike the rest of society. Am I right?
(sighs)
People with their
opinions and natural reactions to things. They think music is cool
and jokes are funny and recipe videos are pleasant to watch. It's like everyone's in a cult.
Remember the alligator golf course video from last month?
Everyone was so amazed by the prehistoric creature strutting on the green,
but no one had the brains to figure out right away that it's fake. Obviously it can't be real because 'alligator too big.'
If you look at the pixels you begin to see that it looks all weird and stuff.
The walking seems - like, totally animated in like a
classic computer CGI graphics way and why is the guy not scared? I would be scared.
I mean it did happen in Florida
which is basically a pile of alligators shaped like a peninsula, and the people that golf there
did say this gator is almost like a mascot of the place that everybody knows, but still. I just don't think it looks
right and also this other angle taken from another phone is totally fake too.
It's actually kind of obvious when you know what to look for. Let me illustrate with another one of your requests.
Ah, here's a goodie - the Flyboard Air. A company that makes water jetpacks suddenly came out with a personal flying machine? Ha, as if.
Are we supposed to believe that
Technologies now exist that make an invention like this possible even though just a few years ago
they did not? I don't think so.
Just ask yourself, ""have I ever seen jet turbines lift something that proportionally heavy?
And where's the fuel supposed to be? The backpack?
Oh. Well, what kind of fuel is it?
Well, how come the video has fake-looking edits during the landing? And I don't hear about how there are a bunch of other videos
of uninterrupted takes showing an entire flight or an official Guinness World Records breaking flight in front of a huge crowd.
When even a ufologist claims that the whole thing is an elaborate hoax, you know it's gotta be fake.
Debunked. What else you got? Talk to me Facebook.
Hm, let's see.
""When you get a chance, you know, not right away, may you debunk this?""
I sure may Zack.
(a woman screams)
Whatever this is, it's totally fake because just look at it.
Graphics don't float on water. They go on paper or skin. I certainly wouldn't be able to figure out how to do this
and Occam's razor dictates that therefore no one could.
So even if we type the word thats under the video into the internet and find a detailed article
about this printing technique. We can be sure that it's wrong
Wikipedia? Please. It's run by a cabal of critical-thinking
extremists obsessed with perpetual refinement of factual information through rigorous citation of credible sources.
You can't trust that (explicative).
(device starts malfunctioning)
But I don't have to tell you that. You're a proper skeptic
you know you can't trust anything you see on the internet or hear on the news anymore period. End of thought process.
[Captain D]: No!
What's more likely? That flimsy explanations about
exposure ratios, movement in a vacuum, or how Hollywood movie props aren't labeled with letters prove that we actually
went to the freaking moon like some sci-fi fairy tale?
Or that maybe it was filmed on a soundstage as part of a global conspiracy by the old powerful and extremely well-funded
government Organization, NASA.
[Captain D]: (banging on the glass) No! Stop!
Come on.
Humans getting into spaceships and risking their lives to prove that the Earth, our home
is just another rock and an endless void of rocks and dust. I'm not ready to accept that yet.
I'm not ready to accept that Paul McCartney
isn't a look-alike who was secretly enlisted into the Beatles after the real Paul died in a car crash in 1966. Look it up.
The evidence is everywhere. And I'm not ready to accept that a group of deeply misguided individuals
could put about as much effort as it takes to create one of my videos
into destroying two of the tallest buildings in the most iconic city in the western hemisphere and killing
three thousand people.
Those people
must have been actors.
They didn't die. The whole thing is a carefully orchestrated hoax by powerful people more capable than any of us
They do it all the time.
When a natural disaster a bombing or a shooting
causes innocent people to die,
it's probably not real.
And someone, even if they didn't have our best interest in mind,
was in control.
Because if no one was in control
that would be terrifying.
(an explosion)
[Captain D]: Enough!
It is terrifying,
but the terror
wears off, and if you're willing to endure feeling disillusioned for a while,
you get to see the world through new eyes.
A world where rationality and critical thinking lead to empathy and social growth.
[Imposter D]: Don't tell me about social growth.
[Captain D]: Who are you?
[Imposter D]: I'm Zeitgeist,
the spirit of the age.
And they're with me.
[Captain D]: If you're so popular, what's with the chameleon routine?
[Imposter D]: The Zeitgeist tends to change.
[Captain D]: Well, I tend to kick the ass of anyone who kidnaps me and messes with the minds of my viewers.
So let's settle this.
[Imposter D]: Not tonight, honey.
I have a headache.
[Captain D]: Listen to me: the power to tell real from fake doesn't come from being a world expert or
Mistrusting every single thing you see. It comes from an honest willingness to change your opinions and beliefs based on new facts.
So learn to enjoy being wrong.
The world might start making more sense.
You won't feel quite as out of step with the rest of humanity,
your words won't cause needless pain to people who suffered real tragedies, and the words of others
won't sway you into believing myths over truth.
You'll be able to
love with your heart, but use your head for everything else."

You post em'... we'll roast em! Let's DEBUNKULATE!
Mr. Flare: Blocked due to a copyright claim by Sony Pictures Television.
Jeff Vance from Salem, Oregon, asks,
""Dear Captain, you might want to check out some of the free energy devices sometime.
Like this one.""
Not really a question, Jeff.
I've seen these. Someone builds a contraption and claims that
magnets can make it spin forever and generate unlimited energy.
A magnetic engine?
Also known as a ""perpetual motion machine.""
I got this, Beakman. Jeff, if these videos are fake,
there's about a million ways to create
the illusion using mechanical effects.
First -
IF these videos are fake?
Oh captain, my captain... we don't need to know how a perpetual motion machine was faked
to be certain that it was.
How can that possibly be?
Because such a device is against the law.
I knew it! It's a conspiracy by big oil
to keep free energy technology out of
the hands of the public! Wake up, sheeple!
No, no, no, no, Ellie... I'm talkin' about the laws of thermodynamics.
If you spin a wheel, by itself, in the vacuum of outer space,
it will keep on spinning, at the same speed, forever, because there's
nothing out there to stop it.
Zaloom! Perpetual motion. But, if you try to use the wheel to power something else,
it won't work.
The first law of thermodynamics tells us that energy, which makes our wheel move,
can't be created or destroyed - only
converted into other forms.
If the wheel is attached to a bicycle, the friction on the axle converts
the wheel's kinetic energy into heat.
So eventually, when all that energy has
escaped, the wheel will stop.
The second law of thermodynamics tells us that this process is a one-way street.
It can't be reversed. Here on Earth,
there's also air resistance and gravity
acting on the wheel.
So it'll stop spinning even sooner - no matter how well-oiled it is.
You can't win.
A machine won't put out more energy than you put in.
Worse, you can't even break even. A machine won't run forever,
unless you keep putting energy into it.
Ok, fine, but the people in the videos ARE putting energy into their magnet engines.
They're using magnets.
I hate to burst your bubble there, D man,
but magnets are not a source of energy.
Then, what do you call this? *gasp*
I call that a waste of potential.
Now, are you tellin' me that you kids in the 21st century still don't know how magnets work?
Well, it was a trending topic once because of a song, and...
I think I bought the song, but... didn't click on any of the articles.
Oh, brother! All the stuff in the universe is made of atoms,
each of which has a nucleus with some electrons zippin' around it.
These electrons have what physicists call, ""spin"".
When a whole bunch of them in neighbouring atoms spin in the same direction,
they create a magnetic field. We can get this to happen in some metals, turning them into permanent magnets.
Like the ones on your fridge.
I don't know, seems to me like there's
plenty of energy inside magnets.
Well, Captain, as we both know, things are not always as they seem.
Observe. Oh, thank you, Ray, heh... lookin' good!
 &gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much!.
Opposite poles of two magnets attract. The closer they get to each other,
the more the two magnetic fields interact, and potential energy increases.
But once they snap together, all the energy dissipates as heat.
You have to put in just as much work to pull em' apart again.
What about when the same poles of two magnets repel?
It must take energy to push like that.
Yeah, but who's doin' the pushing, the magnets, or you?
Ohhh.
That's nice, Beak, but uh... here's a ""Fast Fact"" for ya.
Regular, non-perpetual motion motors, have magnets in them.
Ah, they do, but not just any magnets - special magnets, that can be turned on,
or off, with electricity - called...
Electromagnets.
&gt;&gt; Which we already covered in uh...
Season 4, episode 13.
&gt;&gt; Of Beakman's World!
So, motors?
&gt;&gt; *gasp* Oh, I know this!
Every electric motor has 2 basic parts, the rotor - the thing that rotates -
and the stator - the thing that stays still.
Both are lined with a combination of permanent and electromagnets.
When some of the electromagnets in the stator are turned on,
they attract magnets in the rotor, making it turn a little.
Then those electromagnets go off, and another set goes on, turning the rotor further.
Over and over, the magnets in the rotor chase the magnetic fields in the stator,
and the motor shaft spins.
Oh, amazing Ellie, how do you know so much about electric motors?
I'm saving up for a Tesla.
Oh, ah...
&gt;&gt; Tesla is a car now.
Huh, fascinating.
Wait a minute, I think I just got i!
It's not the magnets that drive the motor, it's the changing current!
As long as you have electromagnets turning on and off on the stator or the rotor,
or on both, things'll move!
That's right! But -
&gt;&gt; But if you have permanent magnets on both sides,
the whole contraption will get stuck faster than the clock I filled with mayonnaise that time.
Yes, because of -
&gt;&gt; Because of something called, ""cogging torque.""
Boy, you're really gettin' the hang of this.
When two magnets are close together, it's not just their closest poles that are interacting,
it's their magnetic fields as whole.
So in a set up like this, the magnets are doing just as much pulling as pushing.
Try it for yourself, and you'll see that instead of spinning fast,
the rotor gets stuck whenever the stator
magnet
is exactly half-way between each pair of rotor magnets.
They lock together like the teeth of two invisible cogs.
Which means you'd have to get... creative to make your machine appear to work.
For instance, you could put a reed switch in the housing of the fan,
to have it activate from proximity to the magnet and power the motor with a button cell.
Or, you could connect two button cells directly to the coil in the glue beads on this contraption.
Or, you could hide a small, powerful motor and battery in the core of this needlessly large device,
then pretend to disassemble it and let gullible observers examine the decorative parts,
while your lackey makes sure that no one gets too close to the actual machine.
The possibilities for fooling an uninformed audience are endless.
So, does this mean magnet engines could never, ever, ever, ever work?
Well, it means that they don't work according to the laws of physics as we understand them today.
In the future, we might make new discoveries that change our core assumptions
about how the universe works,
forcing us to rewrite physics textbooks, and helping us overcome these limitations
in a completely new way. But I wouldn't hold my breath.
So, Jeff of Salem, Oregon, that's the deal with ""free energy devices"".
Ah, it looks my work is done here.
Where are you off to, Beakman?
You know, there's always so much more to learn.
Time to explore the world! I hear Mexico is really nice this time of year.
Remember, love with your heart,
&gt;&gt; use your head for everything else,
see you next time,

if you want to be an artist on the internet,
Congratulations! You already are. Keep making whatever you like to make.
If you want to be an artist on the internet who is popular-
if that's what's important-
then you must find a balance between what you like to make and what the crowd wants to see from the likes of you.
The elusive viral coefficients
So an artist works hard and tries different things. He might start out making some incredibly labor-intensive hyper lapses of buildings
But not receive much of a reaction so he moves on to stop-motion animation and funny
This is how I effects with varying degrees of audience appreciation, but he's still not Vine royalty. And then one day on a whim
He posts a trick loop that changes everything
Are you watching closely?
A game of catch with his own reflection
Ok. What?
Every web community has their own way of dealing with
challenging content. The Imgurians of the west will post gifts that convey complex emotions
They're otherwise incapable of expressing. The Tumblrs of the north will point out ways in which your creation might be
culturally offensive. The 4Chans of the south will find and post those pictures you sent to that one girl.
And the citizens of the floating Metropolis of Reddit will team up and try to figure your trick out
through the time-honored tradition of easily distracted debate
The two schools of thought on the mirrorball video seem to be that it's either a staged shot
and there's no mirror at all, just two people really tossing the ball to each other.
Or that there is a mirror and some sort of
VFX witchcraft is involved. Since my help on the matter has been officially requested
I'm here to officially inform you that it's the latter, but before you burn the young creator of the video at the stake
let's examine exactly, how he did it?
it's a clever trick because it uses physics and optics to do most of the work and just a touch of
digital manipulation to complete the illusion
Thrown at just the right trajectory and with the right amount of force the ball hits the mirror at the apex of its arc
So that the bounced reflection looks identical to what it would have looked like if the ball
continued to travel past the mirror. What seems like a toss into the mirror and back is actually two
Identical bounces against the mirror. During the first the camera follows into the reflection. During the second
it follows back to the hand. Of course there's a second copy of the ball visible during every part of the journey
And often the best use of visual effects is not to add things into the scene
But to subtly take existing things away. Some judicious frame-by-frame
cloning of the background is enough to hide the real ball during the second half of the first bounce
and the reflected ball during the return bounce
okay, let's give this a try
Oh God
Ok. Let's give this a try again
Cool, you'd think the camera shake would make it a challenge to mask the ball
But it actually helps hide the imperfections
filming while performing a series of bounces in a row and then picking the most
Symmetrical pair makes it possible to create a seamless loop that's highly addictive to watch
ladies and gentlemen please welcome

Web videos
A seamingly random jumble of ones and zeros converted into moving pictures have the power to amuse
outraged and arouse us
some even have the power to do all three at once, if you know what I mean
And the winner of today's Internet is
Mirror Ball by animator Kevin Parry this is the first award and 426 nomination for Kevin Parry
coming up King Bach and Zack King"
"
In 2009, a YouTube account called Jevgenij2000 was created to upload a single mysterious video
of a supernatural encounter in the Russian wilderness.
It promoted nothing, didn't ask for likes or subscribers, wasn't embellished with eerie music
or a long-winded text preamble
about how the world is an amazing place.
It just showed a young girl floating in the woods.
Could such a thing have been faked? Of course!
But if it was, what prompted Jevgenij to come up with such a bizarre premise in the first place?
Well, if he was old enough to stage this
in Russia in the late 2000s,
then he might have been a child in Russia in the mid 80s
when otherworldly little girls were
a bit of a pop culture staple.
There was the intrepid guest from the future,
Alisa Seleznyova,
and the Czechoslovakian TV series ""Spadla z oblakov"" (""She Fell from the Clouds"")
better known in Russia as
""Adventures in Summer Break"",
in which a group of kids find a strange little girl levitating over a river in the woods.
Her name is Maika, a super intelligent alien android
who can fly and replicate objects
using a pair of pins from the buckle of her cool belt?
The government wants to catch her, 
she's running out of energy,
and needs the kids' help to return to her home planet...
You know, a ripoff of ET, except four years before ET.
Whoa, whoa, let's not think about that now!
I'm just saying Jevgenij's idea for a girl floating
in the woods may not have been completely random.
But how did he fake it? Let's focus on what we know.
We know it wasn't shot with a phone because
the footage has global shutter and optical zoom.
The file plays at 12.5 frames per second
— half the standard PAL frame rate of 25,
but every frame is actually repeated twice,
making it just 6.25 frames per second.
Someone has to purposefully mess with a video
to make it this choppy.
The camera captures everything clearly,
but then swishes away from the scene
at just the right moment
to miss the girl's descent to the ground.
Hiding a difficult-to-fake moment with messy camera work is an established cinematic technique.
Thanks, O-Blair-Witch.
This is a professionally filmed video 
disguised as a home movie,
so professional visual effects
are not out of the question.
Now, the tiny foreground branches would make it tough to simply composite a fake image of the girl flying,
and she's not so much flying
as hanging at a fixed point in space.
So I think the girl was suspended from a tree,
the rig on which she hung was digitally removed,
and the camera's sudden swish tilt disguised a cut
to a separate shot of the pair running away.
Let's completely stabilize the position, rotation,
and scale of the floating girl,
like some on YouTube have already done, but BETTER,
and watch it rotate on an endless loop
until we've achieved a state
of pure skeptical enlightenment.
I'm starting to see some meandering artifacts behind her head and whatever that is at the base of her leg,
and when I stabilize the part on the ground,
there's like a giant hole in her coat or something.
I know the idea that this group of people
rigged up a rope contraption
from a tall tree in the snowy woods sounds speculative,
but again, consider where the video comes from.
It is an important and popular fact that
Eastern European people love rope swings.
I don't know why, but if you give a Russian child a stick and some rope,
they're going to be performing a daring Tarzan swing over the neighborhood within minutes.
Hey this dog's name is Tarzan!
There's no way for us to know exactly what this rig looked like,
unless Jevgenij chooses to answer the various pleas from Japanese TV stations on his channel page,
but even a pair of aerial straps, which are also a Russian thing, could be used to balance the body in this way.
I think. Let's ask someone qualified like, I don't know,
world-class aerialist, veteran Cirque du Soleil performer, and star of the James Cameron produced 3D film
""Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away"", Erica Linz. Hi Erica!
&gt; Hey, Captain D!
&gt; Hey, do you think you could do this pose on aerial straps?
&gt; Yeah, of course I could.
&gt; Awesome. Would you?
&gt; No.
&gt; Okay, cool cool. So, what else is going on?
&gt; Um, I mean, lots of things. To be honest, I'm super busy actually.
&gt; Oh, no, of course. That's cool.
&gt; I mean, it's really, really nice to see you. I hope everything is good. I just...
&gt; Yeah, I understand that's... I'm sorry.
&gt; No, you're good. You're super sweet, I believe in you, if you could just...
&gt; Just, uh, we'll just catch up whenever, or
&gt; Maybe another time, I...
&gt; No, you're a busy person
&gt; Please?
&gt; and I'm going to...
&gt; Thanks. Can you...
&gt; I'm... you're gonna turn it off or? 
&gt; I don't... I don't know how to turn... you called me
&gt; I'll turn it off. 
&gt; Can you please turn it off?
&gt; Where's the thing? Sorry, it's a little...
&gt; Captain?
&gt; Okay I'm turning you off and... I mean not...
hope I'm not turning you off, I just, nevermind...
&gt; Captain D!
&gt; Yes?
&gt; Now!
&gt; Totally, um,
&gt; Ok. Thank you, bye
&gt; Talk... check you later.
Well, there you have it. Even the most obscure paranormal video could be explained through a
loosely interpreted, imprecise version of the scientific method.
But still, it would really be something to be able to fly."

greetings children
It's me Captain Disillusion my domain is Youtube. A place for measured,
intelligent discussion of substantive issues
but for latest news and trending topics you can't beat the social Media feed a
more efficient way of consuming content that never stops
The other day I saw a video of a bunny being friends with a kitten I
like animals, and I like friendship, so I liked it
Someone posted a video of a non homeless guy being kind to a homeless guy I like
kindness and the outside and rare events like a
Rare event caught on dashboard camera a bolt of lightning striking a car in Melbourne, Australia
Wow
Mistress Nature reminding us that she's in control. I love this kind of thing
Another lightning strike almost hitting a girl on a beach in Sydney, Australia
I like girls
listen to her boyfriend sounding all funny like a real person totally would in this situation. [I] love everything about this
Australia get it together
What's this a long awaited sequel to the iconic Sci-Fi disaster film Independence day?
Starring the latest gwen stefani firmware update Michael munroe, shut up, and take my rubles
Hey, I don't mind seeing some sponsored content
if it means I get
Reliable news in my feed the rest of the time
And I know it's reliable because it's posted by sources who somehow know what I like
Privately funded Portfolio companies like now this news know what they're doing
They've got a staff of dozens posting hundreds of items per day
Ok they might not be able to check their sources as thoroughly as real journalists
But they're dedicated to news as a concept news is in their name. Oh
Ok news might not be in their name anymore
but the point is now this would never try to Blur the line between
Videos of real events and videos of branded content in order to confuse and manipulate me and my less intelligent friends
You know what?
Let me take a look at both of those australian lightning videos again. I'm starting to suspect
They're not as authentic as I've been led to believe
And maybe it's time to put my skeptical hat on
It's true that lightning is a very common weather hazard in Australia
And it's not unreasonable for one or two up close strikes to be caught on video these days
There are countless compilations of spectacular lightning strikes out there but the origins of both of these videos make them
Questionable from the start the car one was posted by now this at some point
But they've since removed it from all their feeds trust me
I checked it all perhaps even they noticed that the original Youtube post was an attempt at a viral ad for a dashboard
video camera for licensing our usage contact licensing at viral hog
Yeah, I'll get right on that by the way. What kind of psychopath is sitting in this car
No reaction of any kind
I'm a pretty calm guy myself, but lightning once struck about 15 feet away from me and even though
I was separated from it by a window believe me when I say I didn't stay still or quiet
Like the car video that beach video seems to have been posted by some unknown third party
[why] are all these personal home videos of amazing things always posted by someone else wouldn't the owner have the motive and opportunity?
To post it themselves. There's ads on the video and it just passed two million views the couple could have made like
$7 for the boyfriend's speech therapy speaking of which we've all thoroughly enjoyed his hilarious reaction after the lightning strike
[Unintelligible screaming] me but just listen to him at the beginning
Hay baby slow down, wait for me. Oh wow, its pretty rocky here hey
Slow down on the rocks baby, its dangerous. nice foreshadowing who wrote this Joe eszterhas
I know all of this is purely circumstantial
Everything I said could be true, and that still doesn't prove that these videos are fake does it you need clear
Observable smoking Phaser evidence of Digital Trickery don't you?
I can do that.
The return stroke of a cloud to ground lightning is very bright it can illuminate an entire zip code from miles away yet
It doesn't manage to completely overwhelm the tiny sensors on these cameras from just a few feet away
here's a beautiful real slow-motion lightning strike captured by Clint Belkin's
Imagine what the view is like from here and while we're looking notice the equally bright reflection extending even into the sand
both of these scenes happen over very wet ground
But there's not even a hint of the lightning's reflection now the creator of the video with the girl
Tried to make it stand up to frame by frame
Scrutiny by simulating the effect of rolling shutter this kind of splitting really could happen with a cMoS chip
But they failed to notice another glitch see this little pink line at the bottom
Whether it was a defect of the gopro sensor a known issue or an artifact introduced later in file encoding
It should always be present on top of the captured image
But the flash makes this line disappear indicating that the flash was added after the fact
The maker of the car video failed to take into account basic physics the deafening air vibrations of the [up-close]
Thunderclap are enough to shake the car in which the [cameras] mounted
But apparently not enough to disturb the suspended wires located much closer to the impact
[I] guess that's not as easy to fake with off-the-shelf plugins and stock effects elements
let's see a video copilot optical flares preset with an implausible anamorphic streak and
Action essentials to charge [o5] mixed with a little bit of dirt charge o6 if I'm not mistaken
This one couldn't help himself either looks like a modified dirt charge. Oh three to me
You know in a real lightning strike water doesn't splash up like a boulder was dropped into it it
Conducts the electrical charge along the surface and electrocutes the people nearby
So what really happened in these videos were they completely staged or just less impressive real events?
Embellished to turn them into viral sensations
[I] don't know there's evidence that this car actually kept going someone spend a lot of effort
Digitally bringing it to a stop, but I can't help wondering why?
To supply the [ever-growing] demands of the social media feed to give me something [to] care about something to like
I already know what I like, and [I] think I'm done letting the feed distract me, or what it is
I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids an optometrist in Spartanburg is about to write a
7,500 word blog post about the benefits of therapeutic touch
Remember love with your heart [use] your head for everything else

First there was nothing. Then, there were motion pictures. The earliest surviving filmstrip is a pickup artist
negging a girl at Roundhay Garden in 1888. Points, bro!
Then there was the first movie blockbuster: ""Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat,"" in 1895.
Soon followed by its remake in 3D. I'm not kidding, that actually happened.
It wasn't until someone discovered the power of cutting from one shot to another
that an art form was born.
A cut between two different images can convey a meaning not contained in the images themselves.
A  cut between two similar images is a jump cut.
Some French people can pull it off, but usually it's pointless and unpleasant.
Pointless and unpleasant...
But a well-timed cut between two nearly identical images can be invisible, and look like pure magic.
It's a foundation of the entire film visual effects industry and more importantly of all the most popular vines!
Zach: ""Jumping through closets/fences/walls.""
There's really not much Zach King does that Georges Méliès didn't do 112 years ago.
Do you realize what that means?
It means you can be a Vine Star, too!
Set your camera up and don't move it. Shoot both parts of your trick video continuously,
then take out the middle to create the cut. That's it!
""This is how I do a thing!""
It worked!
...oh.
To take that all the way to Zach King level you'll have to, you know,
develop clever ideas and comedic timing and technical skills to dress the cut and make it truly invisible.
Here are:
Robot voice: FOUR WAYS TO DRESS YOUR CUT
Number One:
Wiggle Wiggle
Magnify your static shot in your editing program and move it around to give it a
handheld look and hide the cut amid the jerky motions.
Things look more real the more terribly. they're filmed!
Number Two:
Musical Chairs
Move the camera freely, but set it still for the moment the cut has to happen,
and seamlessly substitute the stillness with the fake wiggling.
I once fooled 58,000 people for four years that way.
Number Three:
Jack-In-The-Box.
Do the invisible cut twice to make it look like the subject goes in and out of a container,
with which you then do something incredibly violent.
Number Four:
Switcheroo.
Use two similar looking props to bridge the cut as a sort of reverse misdirection
by focusing attention on the object, all the other imperfections in the cut will go unnoticed,
and the object itself will appear to transform
yummy that should be enough to get you started
Think of your own ways to dress the invisible cut and then share them with someone other than me.
It's a great exercise in attention to detail, because guess what?
That's not ""Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat,"" THIS is ""Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat!"" Ha! I got you, good!
I'm gonna put these things here, so people know to laugh at you. Because you've been D'd by the D itself.
Internet!

Captain: Greetings, children. Captain Disillusion here.
Today, I thought we'd slow things down and talk about -- Whoa, what the hell is that!?
It's some sort of alien craft floating in the distance. Is that real?
Well, we can't be sure -- it's important to keep an open mind!
Let's pass the video around the internet a million f***ing times and argue about personal anecdotes in the comments.
That's my impression of you.
I'm sorry, it's just the end of the year, and I'm a little jumpy.
Thank you Zaphroid. Back to your pen.
Zaphroid: [roars]
Captain: Back!
Good boy.
Believe it or not, video views are a limited resource. When you're watching something stupid, you're not watching something cool.
And you've only got 28,000 days of an average human lifespan to watch everything you're ever gonna see.
So why do over 700,000 of you choose to waste them on watching this?
A video called ""HUGE UFO over India filmed from airplane window"" shows a UFO filmed from an airplane window.
It's not shaped like a flying saucer -- because that's just what they'd want you to think -- and after floating peacefully for a few seconds
it descends and disappears under the canopy of clouds.
When I first saw this video, my reaction was something like, [scoffs]
and when I saw the view count I was like, [gasp].
But then, below in the comments, I saw something that made me go, ""hmm...""
Most people don't actually seem to believe the video is real.
But their explanation for what they're seeing usually comes down to three letters:
CGI.
You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you've become accustomed to define it as. Let's get to know the industry terminology.
This is computer generated imagery.
It's stuff that's constructed, animated, lit, and rendered entirely inside the computer by a team of talented young artists with cute Nordic accents.
Animator: I don't know what's--
Captain: Look at them, they're so adorable!
This is special effects -- mechanical stuff and pyrotechnics that happen on the movie set.
This is visual effects, stuff that happens in post.
This is a subset of visual effects called compositing.
And this is a subset of amateur compositing called s****y garbage view-grubbing UFO bulls**t.
Wait a minute, rather than me trying to explain it, I've got something around here.
No... no... ah, here it is!
I've got a tape, my favorite TV show, which explains all about this particular art form.
[VCR whirring]
[""How It's Faked"" theme begins]
Narrator: UFO videos soar high in views with each new social media platform
but the techniques for faking them are as old and played out as Myspace.
Every UFO fake starts as an idea in the mind of its creator.
This up-and-coming hoax artist finds his inspiration on a standby flight to Atlantic City.
He begins by carefully filming a background image called a plate, which will become the foundation of the composite shot.
He then gathers assets from which to generate the object that will be fashioned into the UFO.
And takes the rest of the evening to clear his mind and prepare for the challenging digital work ahead.
The hoaxer uses specialized photo retouching software to fashion the images he gathered into potential spaceship designs.
Then selects one that seems to best match the lighting in the background plate.
He inserts the ship into the background plate and links it to the tracked motion of the clouds.
When he animates a mask to create the illusion of the ship disappearing into the clouds, he discovers a mistake.
The clouds were tracked at the wrong depth,  causing the ship to slide unrealistically.
But that's okay. He knows that the audience won't notice or care.
Their desire to believe the UFO is real will automatically endow the video with a necessary level of realism.
They'll probably even interpret ordinary optical artifacts, such as the flare from the sun being refracted
into tiny dots by the glass in the window as orbs escorting the mothership.
As a final touch, the hoaxer adds camera defects, flashes, and shaking to the image.
It may seem counterintuitive for an object filmed with a modern, high-resolution, auto-stabilized sensor to somehow become more difficult to see when it's larger
but this is a time-honored tradition of hoax culture, and continues to be preserved.
Now, it's time to upload the finished video to the internet, tag it with appropriate keywords, and promote it to people who might find it interesting.
With the hard work completed, the hoaxer carefully monitors the view count on his masterpiece...
...And is rewarded as it quickly swells to an impressive size.
Passion for the paranormal, dedication to the craft of fakery, and a little bit of talent
beam the creator of this UFO video up to a place in history.
That's our show, everybody. I want to thank all the YouTube subscribers, thank you bloggers, thank you Reddit,
Thank you MSNBC, Space Channel, and a special thanks to every single supporter on Patreon. You guys rock!
Love with your heart, use your head for everything else. See you next year!

Greetings children,
Captain Disillusion here and uh...
...well...
...I'm out of ideas.
I've sat here and debunked just about every type of fake viral video there is.
And I need new challenges...
So bring it on!
Post requests on my Facebook,
tweet links at my Twitter...
...lay qwertys on my slackwave--
Ah!
Here we go!
Just do me a favor: keep it interesting.
Don't ask for the really obvious videos...
Like that ""mysterious"" floating city over China one, okay?
Could you debunk that
mysterious floating city over China video?
Okay - what did I just say?
Mysterious floating city over China, please.
Damn it!
The floating city--
[increasingly urgent chorus of voices 
requesting the floating city]
Argh! Fine!
I can't believe you're making me do this.
A video surfaced last month showing...
...what appears to be...
...giant futuristic buildings floating in the clouds...
...above the city of Foshan
in the Guangdong province of China.
Spoiler alert: it's not real.
Blogs and news reports said...
...it's an example of a rare,
naturally occurring optical illusion.
But I say it was a deliberate fake.
So who's right, the media or a guy in a tracksuit?
Well, let's start our investigation by consulting
an expert on all things optical.
Mr. Flare: Man she told me she was 16--wha?
D:  Mr. Flare.
Uh, what's your take on the floating city in China?
Mr. Flare:  Ah, that?
*clears throat*
That was nothing more...
...than a type of atmospheric mirage
called Fata Morgana.
D: Really?
And uh... what is that exactly?
Mr. Flare [uncertainly]:  Well... it's a...
...sort of like optical illusion, you know?
It makes you see things that aren't there.
Like cities.
D: Uh-huh.
You just saw the term ""Fata Morgana""
in a post by IFL Science...
...and you're repeating it, aren't you?
Mr. Flare: Noo!
I saw it in a post by The Independent!
...and I'm repeating it.
D: So you don't really know
what the hell you're talking about, do you?
Mr. Flare: Nope!
D: Thanks a lot.
Mr Flare: You're welc--
D: I'd like to take a moment to talk 
about lazy journalism.
It's more common online
than abbreviations of branded website names.
Whoever originally broke the story 
about the floating city video...
...had their heart in the right place.
They probably wondered if there was
a natural explanation for the event...
...and googled the word ""mirage"".
After enjoying the various enticing offers
from a hotel in Las Vegas...
...they saw basic information about how mirages work...
...and that one rare type is called Fata Morgana.
They must have liked its evocative name
and immediately picked it for their story.
And then a great game of
journalistic hot potato began...
...as the claim bounced from blog to blog
without any examination.
Reporter: This is a type of superior mirage
called a ""Fata Morgana"".
It can make objects appear
like a city floating in the clouds.
The same phenomenon happens 
when you're driving in your car on a hot day...
...and you see what appears to be water or something liquid on the road in the distance.
D:  Wrong!
She didn't even read four lines down on Wikipedia.
So maybe instead of trusting her...
...we should check
what Fata Morgana actually is ourselves.
Mirages happen when light is bent by layers of different temperature air along the Earth's surface.
There are two types of mirages:
inferior and superior.
An inferior mirage is when stuff from above the horizon appears under the horizon line.
A superior Mirage is when stuff from below
the horizon line appears above it.
Fata Morgana is an extra shimmery...
...multi-layered type of superior mirage
that occurs in rare atmospheric conditions.
But mirages are not hallucinations.
All they do is displace the view of things that are actually there to begin with
they can make patches of the sky
Appear as lakes on the desert floor
or make distant boats seem to hover above the ocean surface
But they can't make a futuristic metropolis...
...manifest out of nowhere
in a modestly developed area.
And by the way all mirages
- including Fata Morgana -
can only appear very close to the horizon line...
...because that's the view...
...at which the refractive properties
of the different layers of air are most pronounced.
No mirage can extend thousands of feet up
as in this video.
So if the floating city wasn't a Fata Morgana mirage, what was it?
Well, either it was a real paranormal thing
that appeared in the sky...
...or someone faked a video of it.
What do you think, Paranormal Crucible?
This mysterious apparition was possibly
the result of a project blue beam test...
...or perhaps was a temporal vortex...
...a possible parallel universe...
... materializing briefly into our own reality.
Uh... that sounds bat-[beep] crazy.
Say something a little less crazy.
It is possible,
considering China's technological achievements...
...that a top-secret holographic technology...
...was tested over a heavily populated city...
...in an effort to gauge the general public's reaction.
Oookay...
So the government did a secret test
that they wanted the whole city to see?
Initial reports did claim that this apparition
was witnessed by thousands.
Something so huge would have to be.
But... where are all these people?
No eyewitnesses have been interviewed
or quoted in any of the articles.
No report can even specify exactly when this took place.
Nowadays when people mistake
ordinary rocket launches for UFOs
- which is kind of sad -
we end up with tons of witness videos...
...taken from different vantage points
on YouTube within hours.
But all images of the floating city...
...come from a single, short, low-quality video clip.
Where have I seen that before?
That leaves us with the least unlikely possibility...
... the video was faked using
the dark art of visual effects...
...which happens to be my specialty.
Creating this short effect shot is so easy...
...you won't even feel bad...
...when Ang Lee doesn't thank you for it
in his Oscar acceptance speech.
Thank you Movie God!
We need to accomplish three things...
Film a skyline...
...match an image of buildings
to the exact motion of the camera...
...and place the image behind
some of the real features in the shot.
As with any view of a stationary landscape
shot from a single vantage point...
...the motion in this video can be tracked...
...using just... two points.
One measures the change in position...
...the other the change in rotation.
We apply that information
to the item we want to put in the scene...
...and it instantly tracks into place in a realistic way.
To put it behind real objects in the video...
...we can do some manual rotoscoping...
...or as in the case of this video...
...use the luminance difference in the clouds...
...to automatically generate a mask...
...hiding part of our fake item.
All that's left to do is
replace the item with a futuristic cityscape.
Now where could we possibly
get our hands on something like that?
*furious google searching*
There!
Why, that looks real enough to be explained
as a mirage on CNN.
Oh wait...
It WAS.
Over 93,000 reports and no one got it right.
Maybe that's okay when it comes to a floating city in China.
The world never actually believed
that could be real and...
...a proxy explanation of ""mirage"" was good enough.
But what about other news stories
where the details matter?
Where political nuances and scientific accuracy can shape public opinion about important issues.
How many journalists don't read past four lines
on Wikipedia before writing those reports?
And how many click hungry bloggers 
repost them without checking?
I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids!

purchase a DIY acupuncture kit.

Greetings children, it's me Captain Disillusion...
or is it? (electronic voice repeats) or is it?
(Normal) Gotta stay on your toes.
You never know what fakery will be sprung on you these days...
Lithium filter scams,
black-market bionic implants,
thumb theft.
Those are just some of the premium topics you can hear me discuss right now
for only $749.99
(under his breath) My monthly two year subscription commitment required!
(Normal volume) But let's move on to today's free topic:
(Captain Disillusion) The time traveler conspiracy. (Woman) Try my buffalo placenta makeup line!.
(Fast electronic speaking)
Back before palm tags and neural interfaces,
people used to carry their communication devices in their hand like a brick.
They called them cellular mobiles
and they were so obsessed with these objects they used to think they could see them everywhere,
even in ancient 2D movies,
like this shot from promotional footage of the
1928 premiere of Charlie Chaplin's film The Circus
where a passing woman appears to be talking on a mobile
or this scene from the Old Western Fort Apache,
made in 1949,
where Henry Fonda appears to check his GPS
on what looks like an iPhone,
or even this 1938 archival shot
where a young lady appears to be finishing her conversation
on what is clearly a Samsung Galaxy S6.
It might sound silly,
but there are people who really take this brand of conspiracy theory seriously.
They believe various photos and films
have captured secret time travelers trying to blend in among the crowd.
Entire online communities are dedicated to tracking down such evidence.
This 1949 photo of a reopening ceremony for a bridge in Canada
made the rounds in the media
because one guy looks too much like a modern day hipster.
Seems more like a ziphead to me.
And for over a decade,
people have followed the posts of a person calling themselves John Titor
who claimed to be a soldier from the future
on a mission to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer
in order to prevent a catastrophic technological problem in the year 2036
...but apparently made a pit stop in our time
to answer some questions on a message board.
I get it.
The possibility of time travel is very appealing.
We could verify history books.
Evolutionary psychology could finally become a science,
but the conspiracy theorists don't care about that.
They just like sci-fi stuff,
and they can stand to zoom out a little...
...zoom out of the tiny world of anomaly hunting
and look at the big picture.
I think this woman is just scratching the side of her head
and not just because we can't confirm there's an object in her hand at all.
I think this girl timidly holds her glasses case against her cheek
and not just because she's passing a documentary film crew aiming a camera at her,
and I think Henry Fonda is looking at an ordinary notepad,
not just because we can see the bottom of it right in the shot.
It's because these devices needed giant metal towers every few miles
and space satellites to work...
...infrastructure that didn't exist in these times.
Also, this one's a movie.
Think about that for a second.
And as we continue to gain perspective,
we might realize that one man's slightly peculiar look
doesn't have to automatically unravel the very fabric of reality
because shielded sunglasses, sports team sweaters,
and miniature cameras all existed by the 1940s.
Give the guy a break. He just wanted to feel cool,
much like that Reddit guy who claimed to have two sonic...screwdrivers,
Or like a group of nerds in Florida
who, perhaps inspired by a Pat Frank novel,
wanted to impress a gullible old man on the radio,
so they put together their various skills and art,
computer science and bulls**t,
to create a mystery figure,
a sort of geek Banksy,
but then they realized they could commercialize it
and started making all kinds of stupid decisions
until the whole thing just kind of fell apart...
...sucks when that happens...
but if you zoom out far enough,
you'll realize that space and time
are an interwoven continuum
in which, as relativity shows us,
perception of time is dependent on velocity and strength of gravitational fields
and even super-intelligent cyborg Stephen Hawking agrees
that, while it's possible to skip into the future by just moving really fast,
travel the other way into the past will most likely forever remain a fiction.
So the next time an anachronistic detail catches your eye,
calm down, step back and take a look at the big picture.
Then, if you still feel an urge to argue with people on the internet,
maybe it's time to take a break and go outside.
It's always a good idea to step out, take a breath of fresh air,
bask in the weather-service regulated sunlight
and rest easy knowing the scientific consensus is clear...
...time travel is impossible.
Huh! A flying Delorean.
Haven't seen one of those in thirty years.
What the hell is going on here?
(groans and gasps)
Oh no...
...this can't be happening!"
"
Ladies, Fall season is here.
So bust out the ellipses because
dots are in!
[upbeat rock music]
I mean, I don't know much about fashion,
but they must be in!
Because what other possible explanation could there be
for this video having two and a half million views?!
[mystical synth music]
It's about two blurry dots, one dot moves slow,
Another dot moves fast, then one abducts the other!
And this conclusively proves
or totally disproves the existence of extraterrestrial UFOs!
...According to the world's saddest comment thread located under the video.
But if you look closer, they're actually tiny flying pigs.
Because guess what? Anyone can track a point on the foreground features in this handheld footage
and stick in whatever primitive dot animation they want!
Meanwhile, in another quadrant of the YouTube™ Galaxy,
a creative video maker who incidentally is the source behind many trippy
perpetual .GIFs you've probably been coming across for years,
* /gifs/*
made this.
A real trash bin becomes a false-perspective picture of a trash bin on the pavement.
For realsies!
A cool mind-bender, no?
Well, I like it. It's almost more mind-bending for someone familiar
with visual effects than it is for an average person
See, when I look at it, I know that making the bin appear as a flat image on the ground is not that hard,
but I also know that the *real* bin had to still be there, obscuring the view behind it,
and making that invisible was the real challenge.
Allow me to illustrate using this ordinary cat.
We film the cat sitting on the ground, then pick a frame where the anamorphic effect will start.
We then motion-track the rest of the shot using planar tracking.
Unlike point-tracking or 3D-tracking, planar tracking analyzes whole clusters of pixels in a given plane,
to track how that plane appears to distort over time.
When we apply this tracking data to the still frame of our cat, we cause that frame
to follow the optical distortion of the ground plane for the rest of the shot.
But when we isolate the cat to make it look like a picture on the ground, the real cat behind is still visible!
We have to disguise it with a patch of the background from the still image.
But that only works if whatever the cat obscures is flat along the ground surface.
Vertical objects will distort incorrectly, so we must isolate those and anchor them to the ground plane
using a mathematical expression, crafting which will take most of you the rest of your natural lives...
Unless you look it up in a very old tutorial on a popular After Effects™ plugins website.
And so, whether it's a cat, a droid or a trashbin,
our clever perception-challenging visual effects shot is complete!
And like the mighty Dave of Sheepfilms,
who had to clone a post and patch-composite some shadows and a skateboarder
to make his effect flawless,
we are ready to publish our masterpiece and receive the viral avalanche of ...
4,600 views?
Wha–?
*inaudible cursing*
*sigh* I guess there's just no accounting for lack of taste.
*dialing* Hello, Coast-To-Coast? Yeah I seen a UFO object. It was flying real high
with a blinking light.
Huh?
About as fast as a plane."

Greetings children, it's me, Captain Disillusion
Here's a fun trick you can try at home
time travel to the 1920s and get a silk handkerchief and stuff it into your hand like this
And poof, it's gone. as you probably know the secret is a fake thumb tip which serves as misdirection for the tiny
disposable micro singularity generator
which consumes the handkerchief and then itself, so you finish clean
Pretty simple stuff, really, but with practice you'll be ready for more complex illusions such as this
Youtuber Dan D'Entremont shows us an amazing
water trick, which since its appearance four long years ago has gathered over 13 million views and never been debunked
Did you know that if you twist an upside down glass of water just right you can lift it and the water will stay in
the shape of the glass quivering in a delicately balanced spin until the slightest disturbance collapses it
Wow
Now I know the stunts in this video looks enticingly doable
But trust me you don't need to waste water, towels, or your time trying it.
That's terrible advice.
Oh, man.
""If at first you don't succeed try try again"", Ghandi.
Holly
This is odd. I'm seeing you and yet
I'm not currently crawling back on my hands and knees.
Let's not dwell on the past D, that's not who I am anymore. After our breakup
We were never together
I did some soul-searching and I found the souls and put them back
I got really annoyed and actually unleashed an illness on the infants of southern Gantuar.
It was gross, I felt bad,
but then I thought, I'm only as bad as I allow myself to think I am, you know?
You killed starving babies?
And I choose to be positive. I'm a positivist.
What does that entail?
Not ignoring possibilities, D! We don't know everything
- Maybe ear candling works.
- Uhm...
Maybe there's a way to make a guy who completely rejected a beautiful deity
love her again through a series of incantations.
- I feel I'm qualified to say that... no!
- And just maybe water has memory
And you shouldn't dismiss the possibility that this trick could be done.
Don't fill these poor kids minds with doubt.
""Anything is possible.""
Steve Jobs.
Then how about a challenge: if you can reproduce the amazing water trick here in the real world.
I'll give you a million dates with me.
Oh I'm above such...
Really? I mean, that's only two thousand seven hundred and forty years of dates, but
Okay.
Let's do this
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the first and last annual million date challenge
Holly is going to attempt to recreate the amazing water trick. Are you ready?
I predated the universe ready.
Very well, please begin.
Poor, cynical D. Your mind is closed off to so much
Water, like your deeply buried feelings for me, is infinitely complex
I mean it's already documented that it can be walked on parted and turned into wine so
Who's to say it can't hold the shape of a glass for a few seconds when spun of just right?
Frankly I don't want to live in a world where something is impossible.
Oprah Winfrey.
Hmm, it doesn't seem to have worked.
Well, thank you for joining us at the first and last annual mil-
Are you crying?
There's no crying as skepticism.
I just really believed I could do it
I guess not everything is possible.
Welcome to reality. Would you like to know how the trick was really done?
Yeah.
This Dan is a clever guy. First,
he mentally primed us to expect something plausible by pretending his video is just a fun
tutorial and starting with a stunt that looks impressive, but really can be done, and once our guard was down,
he unleashed a visual effect, which starts simply, but becomes extremely convincing once this happens.
Think about it: would you have been as impressed if the video ended here,
before the cameras picked up and moved?
Not really. If the camera doesn't move that's like photoshopping a still picture,
or doing an old-timey movie effect.
Exactly.
He could have just added some shimmering distortion in the shape of a glass and called it a day,
and that might have looked convincing in the times of Georges Méliès.
But today it could be done by even the most overrated crowd pandering amateur visual effects artists in the world.
«This is how I eat rice krispies.»
Hmm. This is how I punch people.
The uninterrupted handheld camera move is what sells the whole thing.
We see the water perfectly anchored to the counter and changing perspective,
interacting with the light and refracting the background. There's no easy way to fake that.
So how did he do it?
Let me introduce you to the world of 3d motion tracking.
See, when the camera moves like this,
it's called a nodal pan. It's not really moving at all it's just panning and tilting across a two-dimensional view.
It's pretty easy to track this kind of motion and add fake items into the scene.
But, when the camera actually is changing position, perspective shifts
and it becomes exponentially more complicated to track.
You have to know the details of the camera and the lens, track many points in the image,
and then put it all together through some complicated math,
to calculate a virtual recreation of the camera moves in 3d.
Once you have that, you can do just about anything.
Dan lifted an empty glass, and filmed the shot with nothing on the counter
except perhaps a few well-placed markers which were later digitally removed.
He tracked the shot and recreated the camera move in the 3d animation software of his choice,
there he modeled and textured the water object and most likely part of the counter surface,
matched the lighting of the scene and rendered the animation with the real shot projected as a background.
This made it possible for the water to reflect and refract the room in a realistic-looking manner
and if that sounds too sophisticated,
just take a look at the other videos on the guy's YouTube channel, or his IMDB credits.
He does some pretty impressive 3d animation. I'm saying that and I'm super picky.
Seriously I nit pick everything.
Speaking of which, toward the end of the shot he had to do some manual 2d adjustments to the water
and you can see it wobble slightly.
The ending is a simple transition to a separately filmed moment,
when he spilled real water onto the counter from off-screen.
It's masked by a few frames of the CG water collapsing
which if you look closely, is a pretty basic 2d composite of a still image of the water simply scrolling down.
Do you understand now?
I understand.
Of course!
I was facing south, that's the problem!
Water spins in the opposite direction on the southern hemisphere so that must have interfered
with my twisting motion, otherwise it totally would have worked. Yes!
No, no, no, come on!
Thanks for helping me figure it out, D. I'm ready for my dates now.
- But you didn't beat the challenge. 
- The challenge was biased!
How is it biased? We agreed on the rules and you failed.
Well, you...
You know what? I'm fine. I'm refocusing, I'm finding my center, everything's great.
Why can't you just see things the way they are? It's so much easier.
I'm going now.
Enjoy boringly explaining ""reality"" to your sad little friends. I'll be busy studying law...
The law of attraction. And one day the universe will guide you where you belong...
On my face!! Holly out!
Well, I tried.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids.
A policymaker in Australia is actually on the brink of changing her mind about something
Remember: love with your heart, use your head for everything else.
And be excellent to each other.

The universe is full of big mysteries. Is there a supreme intelligence
responsible for all creation?
(Are we alone?)
What is the point of these little stickers and then there are the casual tiny mysteries like this?
the basketball just
disappears
Where did it go? Let's watch it again?
Ha let's watch it again
Let's watch [...] Holy crap! We watched it over a million times
Ironically a tiny mystery can be tougher to deal with than a big one
After all if all that happens after death is that we turn to dust at least we'll be dust together among the storm
But where did the ball go. Oh God. this is why every single Magician at some point in their career
gets punched in the face
every
single one
don't try to hide it sally
own it
the only way to stop the cycle of abuse and get a grip on the
physical universe is to understand the laws of physics that govern it
That's like where the name of our universe comes from
Law of inertia also known as Newton's first law of motion
States
An object in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless
Something something the last time we see the ball it gets launched back into the left
Back and to the left (x3)
and because of the pesky third dimension
That has made pixar, so successful pixar
objects can go behind other
objects
And when those objects are made of stuff that doesn't let photons pass through like the chunky atoms of a kid playing
Basketball in a soccer t-shirt, I can't see one behind the other and I guess when we don't see something for a while
It's like it doesn't even exist

so the short answer to the question where did the ball go is
It exited frame left tiny mystery solved on to the big ones

Greetings children let's put all our cell phones on silent,
For a tale about pencils and demons quite violent.
#CharlieCharlieChallenge: This game taught us all how some grown-ups act smart, but their minds are quite small.
Many trends send me into a quick anger spiral; more often than not it's the trends that go viral, but in this case,
I don't really feel that annoyed. Why?
 Well back off and maybe we'll get to my point.
First, of the rules of the ""game"". Stack two pencils like so, with a sheet underneath graphing out ""yes""
And ""no"". Ask a question that starts with the chant 
[""C h a r l i e C h a r l i e,""]
 then wait for the pencil to move
Magi . . . cal . . .ly.
When it does, be prepared for how loud things might get, and have towels on hand some pants will be wet.
Kids of various ages will flee with a shiver,
But the secret, of course, is your breath moves the lever.
A crude little game for all those not involved. If you found it annoying, you
Might be too old. See, it's not about ghosts or events paranormal.
It's not about logic informal or formal. It's bonding and fun in a kind of . . .
street cred: the kind of kids get by messing with other kids heads.
though some of them felt that it might be enhanced by increasing saying
[Nigga x2.5]
200%. So no need for debunking, critiquing,
explaining. The game was meant only to be entertaining.
If we find some hard proof of life after death, it will not be through Vine, I would venture to guess.
But when a trend captures the eyes of youth culture,
It's quickly pursued by a gaggle of vultures: old journalists and bloggers clinging to youth, all
Reported about this as if it was news.
Only, there was no angle is it good or bad?
Is it cute or should some moral outrage be had? When a Vatican exorcist offered that it might be dangerous,
We all knew he's full of s***, but the press should try harder.
Research stuff, even like the fact that it wasn't a ""Mexican Demon"" and that once in República
Dominicana, a newscast stirred up some hilarious drama. An old Spanish game that goes back generations
With different forms, at least two machinations, where pencils are used at a demon is summoned is breaking our young peoples'
spiritual hymens!
[clears throat]
Suffice, to say it was quite a slow news week.
Until a new scandalous detail a blog leaked: the meme was a brainchild of mischievous
ad men. An ad for the movie ""The Gallows,"" Let's get them!
Except that it's not. That was clearly made later.
They studied the crowd to which they had to cater. New footage was shot to exploit the new fad, even though
The film *isn't* related to that.
So here we are now and the craze has long passed. I admit that this
overview's somewhat half-assed, but let's learn to distinguish news facts from news junk.
Because some days there's just not much out there to debunk.
I hope that you love with your heart (made of cells), use the head on your shoulders for everything else.
And I'll channel the spirit of Charlie, meanwhile, to remind you to keep your chin up,
and to smile.

On the last episode of Captain Disillusion,
the titular Captain was visited by a legendary mascot
and the future of the entire series fell into jeopardy.
But many viewers got distracted by something much more important
[Many voices simultaneously] ""Tits""
""Nice tits""
""Boobs""
That's right
It seems the character's apparent chesticular fortitude is the most comment-worthy thing in the video
just ask PilotAbileen27
or Monkey Boss
Or tons more eloquent YouTube commenters, for some of whom figuring out whether the character was played by a girl
seems very important because everyone knows that gender is the most fun and relaxing topic to discuss
on the internet. And while it's true that a number of
talented women made the production of Captain Disillusion possible on a monthly basis, Packard Sonic and others simply must know...
Whose boob was in that costume?
Was it mine?
Or mine?
Or mine?
What?
It could've been.
Well the wait is over, Hgulf. It's time to make the truth
go viral. The mascot was played by
the Captain himself!
That's right, xXChrisissocoolXx
Alan, the once trim
But now deceptively flabby creator of the series is the object of your bodily obsession and who can blame you?
When he isn't spending weeks sitting at a computer creating tons of animated graphics to convince you ghosts aren't a thing,
He's stuffing himself into oversized red pants and a tiny girl's jacket in an attempt to make pop culture commentary entertaining.
But we totally respect your right to focus on boobs instead. We respect it so much we're taking this time
to celebrate them.
This is for you, anewman513.
And you, Nicoyutub,
And especially you, Mable Pines. We want to give you all the sweet, sweet gift
of post-hypnotic suggestion.
Relax and take deep breaths. Let waves of relaxation
roll through your body. When this video ends you will click on something else and go on living the rest of your life
But every time you see a hint of cleavage
Under- or side-boob or just plain bare breasts in movies, on TV or in magazines
You will remember these.
Remember them.

Greetings children, Captain disillusion here. What do you say we revisit a topic we haven't properly discussed in nearly six years:
Ghosts. A ghost of particular interest recently is the one that likes to stroll around the happiest place on Terra:
Disneyland
Out of the haunted mansion, through the closed gate, down the pier, and over the surface of the lake.
Four surveillance cameras caught a mysterious figure walking through the park at night in real time.
Terrifying.
See this is why you don't go to Disneyland, but to Walt Disney World in beautiful, Orlando
Florida. Scariest thing that can happen to you there is an alligator might try to preach to you.
*Explosion*
Hiya Pal
Hello?
Can I help you?
Oh don't mind me. Our boys at trademark watch detected the word ""Disney"" uttered three times within a few seconds,
so I'm just dropping by for a simple video audit.
An audit?
Standard procedure to make sure there's no brand
Misappropriation going on. Just do your thing the exact way you usually do it, pretend
I'm not even here and don't have the power to easily shut you down. Go ahead. I'll be quiet as a mouse, huh?
Okay, well then let's dive in to this mystery
Um with a little more character, please
Let's dive into this spooky mystery
Since the only source of detailed information about ghosts, the ""new age section"" of Barnes &amp; Noble, is no longer available to most of us,
the best way to answer the question, ""is this a ghost?"" is by answering the question,
""Could this be something else?""
And the answer is ""yes.""
Goodnight!
*coughs* I would like you to elaborate.
Yes, sir
So what is that something else?
Simple: it's a technical glitch caused by a worn out recording head, capturing footage of an empty park, onto a
recycled VHS tape that already contained a different night's recording of a maintenance worker walking through the same area.
That night things were slightly different: The gate was open, and the last camera was panned further down the path,
which is why the employee looks like he's walking on the surface of the lake instead of along the dock in the last shot.
Beautiful glitches like this were possible with this analog technology which recorded images converted into an electrical signal as
patterns of Magnetic tape.
I'm not an expert, but I know a thing or twenty.
To make a stable image, VHS tape recorded a special control track,
which set the cadence for how to read the video and audio signals
Like the formatting of a hard drive.
So normally each new recording completely obliterated the previous one.
That's why when you accidentally recorded over something important, at the tail end, you'd see noise, and then a slow, painful
re-emergence of the previous recording.
But for certain, professional applications, like video editing or surveillance,
you could dub video or audio on an existing control track laid onto the tape in advance.
That way, you could clean the insert shots into the middle of a video, or make sure there were no
timecode breaks in a tape that's intended to record continuously for dozens of hours.
And that's when all kinds of crosstalk and print through became possible.
I feel a great disturbance in the force, as if a million Reddit users
commented in anger that they've already disproved every aspect of this theory.
Nice cross-promotion, I like it.
Here's the thing though:
almost everyone on Reddit is wrong, each in their own special way.
""So a few years ago. They were still using VHS,
that's hard to believe Disney would not have gone digital by then.""
Wrong. The video was uploaded in 2009,
but there are reasons to believe it was filmed much earlier:
The monitor images have a 4:3 aspect ratio, and the video itself is in 4:3 as well.
The vertical streaking from the lights is an artifact of CCD chips,
which predate the CMOS sensors used in most cameras today.
And the short, consistent shutter speed in the Handheld video makes me think it wasn't recorded with a smartphone, but a camcorder.
""The figure is consistent across changing tapes and cameras.""
Wrong.
Multiple tapes or recorders weren't involved. Most tape based surveillance systems save time and tape
by recording a split screen of all the cameras as a single video on a single tape.
Clearly this is one those.
""Why is there a beam of light coming up from it? If this was just a burned image of a person walking would that be there?""
Wrong. I mean, yes.
I mean, look not everything that shines is gold.
Just because the lights are streaking doesn't mean the streak on the person is caused by the same thing.
This is a previous recording forcing itself through a newly recorded image.
It's based on motion.
The person shows up because the person is the only thing in motion in the older recording; everything else is rendered invisible.
The streak is an artifact of this motion based bleed-through.
Like sticking your head through this smooth,
artificial waterfall of a hotel lobby.
In your face!
And they lived happily ever after.
Good work.
But not good enough. I'm shutting you down.
What?
Your message just isn't compatible with our brand.
Disney is the breeze of a fast approaching hug, the dance of freckles, and a pair of smiling ginger twins.
Disney is the opposite of disillusion.
*Phone rings*
Yeah? I don't know, late. It'll be a while.
What do you want me to say? I have to work. That's what I do, Minnie.
That's what puts cheese on the table and new bows on your head, in case you haven't noticed. I don't care. Do whatever you want
Is everything okay?
I don't know. I'm not sure I ever knew."

Hi, welcome back to Captain Disillusion,
where truth meets fiction,
and fiction meets my fist.
-What?
-[audience laughing]
I’m Captain Disillusion, your guide
to all things real and observable.
-[audience cheering]
-And I’m Mr. Flare,
lens artifact of light,
lenticular clothing expert, and actor.
Really? You tread the celluloid boards?
Since when? You have to tell us more!
Well, as you know, I’ve done some work
in several J. J. Abrams pictures.
Ah, yes. Some would say too much.
Exactly.
And that’s why I decided
to go back to my indie roots
and do a few short films.
That’s literally amazing.
And I understand you brought a clip.
Why don’t you set that up for us?
Well, no one literally brings a clip,
it’s arranged by a publicist
-and downloaded to--
-What’s the film called?
It’s called Rush Hour.
Oh, I love that movie!
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my--
-No, no. Not that one.
-[audience laughing]
This is a web video directed by
filmmaker Fernando Liv-- [bleep].
Roll the goddamn clip, Charlie.
[“Mr. Sandman” by The Chordettes plays]
-[audience applause]
-Wonderful! So much fun.
Yeah, my job was easy.
Just hang there and look pretty.
The stunt drivers are the real heroes.
Stunt drivers?
Yeah, didn’t you see?
All that amazing coordinated driving?
[audience laughing]
-Oh, no. No you don’t.
-[audience boos]
I let you promote your film
because this is a talk show today,
but I draw the line at fake claims.
-Okay…
-If you want to spin a yarn,
better call a gossipy weaver,
because this is my house.
-[audience cheering]
-We deal in truth.
And we all know that was a fake video
done with the visual effects skills
of a handsome Argentinian man.
What we don’t know
is exactly how it was done.
But I’m gonna tell us.
I’m gonna tell all of us.
There ain’t no such thing
as a free lunch.
If you film something
from a completely stationary angle,
it’s easy to digitally manipulate.
But it also tends to look fake
to your young, media-conditioned eyes.
If the camera is moving,
manipulation becomes
much more complicated,
but it ends up looking more convincing.
But what if I told you
that you could have
the best of both worlds
with very little effort?
Just film your scene
with a stationary camera,
manipulate it,
and then add fake camera movement.
That’s what Fernando did.
He filmed moving camera shots
for the beginning and the end,
and seamlessly transitioned them
into a stationary shot
of the main visual effects portion
where he animated fake
subtle camera movement and zooming.
Did you notice that what looks like
a tiny smudge on the lens at the beginning
later looks like a stain on the pavement
because it moves with the picture?
So let’s put that aside
and consider this a stationary shot.
What he actually filmed
was a semi-busy street
where individual vehicles and pedestrians
passed by at different times.
Something like this.
After that, he picked
several candidate cars and people
and meticulously traced them
frame by frame
in a process
old people called “rotoscoping,”
and cool, hip visual effects artists call
“pulling a matte.”
He had to do this because eventually
he would make many copies
of different subjects cross each other
so every edge of each had to be defined.
Now, pulling a matte doesn’t have to be
a brute force tracing effort,
especially if you don’t have a whole team
of inexpensive overseas artists
to handle it for you.
There are various time-saving techniques
you can use.
Enhancing luminance values to define edges,
smart selection tools,
or, particularly useful in this case,
a difference matte.
A difference matte effect
learns what pixels
of the stationary background look like,
then spots and isolates
the different-looking pixels
of moving objects that cross it.
It doesn’t work perfectly,
but it gets you a lot of the way there.
Once all the subjects were matted,
it was time for Fernando
to play compositing jazz.
He combined and offset
various copies of different vehicles
to pass each other centimeters apart
to a delightful old-y tune that…
reminds me…
reminds me I have to do something…
Sorry, what were we talking about?
You were just telling me
how awesome you think my movie is.
-[audience laughing]
-Oh, yes. Wonderful stuff.
I don’t know how they did it.
I don’t think I want to know.
[chuckles]
But it’s amazing.
-Thank you!
-Thank you!
This has been wonderful.
It’s been wonderful!
Don’t forget to try that cleanse!
Don’t forget to never vaccinate anything
because of the quantum effects
of astrological chemtrails!
Absolutely.
-[audience applause]
-Well that’s all the time we--

Greetings, children! Captain Disillusion here.
I was just admiring this pen given to me by the Duke of Delaware in a parellel timeline.
It's a powerful tool.
You can use it to write an essay that changes the world,
Or...
As a weapon... to swiftly kill everyone in the room.
However, this particular pen doesn't write very well.
But, rather than throw it away,
I'm going to use it in my pen mosaic of what I think Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson's baby would look like.
Perfect.
You can tell a lot about a person by the way they deal with malfunctioning technology.
And one of the buggiest technologies ever is being used by YOU, right now.
Web video.
When I see a weird video glitch,
It makes me think of how much I hate the unreliable quality of most video streaming services.
With their pauses and wild fluctuations in resolution.
I need to see a consistent level of detail when I'm watching my 'art' films.
But some people, when they see a video glitch, it makes them think of...
Aliens.
Aliens hiding among us.
The idea has been a staple of science fiction since the 1930s,
But then this British weirdo wrote some conspiracy books taking it seriously.
And now, I kid you not,
There are actual adults who believe that reptilian aliens have infiltrated the highest levels of government and media,
And disguised as world leaders and celebrities.
They control the major events of our world to suit their devious alien agenda.
Their evidence?
Why, the glitches, of course!
See, they're not glitches at all, but wardrobe malfunctions in the aliens' sophisticated human disguise.
Is it a physical costume?
Or a holographic facade?
Or do they have natural, shape-shifting abilities?
YES.
ALL OF THAT.
DOESN'T MATTER.
The point is there's a conspiracy! And you can't see it! Because your eyes aren't open!
You've got to be attuned! Like me!
To notice these things every time they happen to a world famous person on international TV.
Please, visit my website, ""wakeupsheeple.ugh""
(SIGH)
(BEEP)
Look, I already debunked one of these reptilian things a while back,
But they keep showing up!
There's even a Justin Bieber one now.
So, in case you ever find yourself in a debate with a believer in this ridiculous conspiracy,
Let me explain, once and for all, the exact details behind how and why this type of video glitch happens.
(GUNSHOT)
To make video files smaller and easier to stream,
Godless scientists invented 'Compression'.
There are two types of video compression:
'Intraframe' and 'Interframe'.
With intraframe, each individual frame is kept as a unique picture and stripped down as much as possible.
This keeps the motion looking as good as the original, but it doesn't reduce file size by much so it's mostly used by professionals.
Interframe compression goes further by only using full intra-recorded pictures, called 'I-Frames' once in a while,
And filling the rest of the space with a different kind of data called 'Predicted Picture Frames' or 'P-Frames'.
P-Frames only carry information on how to move pieces of the last I-Frame, called 'Macroblocks',
Around to simulate the motion that happens in subsequent frames.
Basically, P-Frames wear I-Frames like a skin suit and puppeteer them around until the next proper I-Frame can take over.
Nowadays, they've also introduced another kind of frame called a 'Bi-Predictive Frame',
But I'm gonna need a signed parental consent form to tell you about those.
Anyway, normally, ths works okay and cuts down on file size.
But, sometimes, if I-Frames are really far apart and one of them gets skipped in a badly copied file,
Or a live stream from pretty boy prison,
The P-Frames keep distorting the picture way beyond what looks acceptable.
They're working from too old a reference.
Like, if someone blinked, and the I-Frame where their eyes opened back up gets skipped,
P-Frames go on moving the closed eyelids around like they're eyeballs,
And suddenly a bunch of conspiracy theorists need to change their pants.
Ignorant conspiracy theorist: ""Please, somebody try to give me a logical explanation for that.""
Captain Disillusion: ""I just did, asshole.""
It's called 'VIDEO TECHNOLOGY'.
In fact, some people have embraced this defect and turned it into an art form called,
'Glitch Hacking' or 'Data Moshing' or 'Pixel F***ing'
There's no consensus on the name but it looks super trippy and 'out there'.
There's even been whole music videos done in this style.
Hey look, here comes Kanye West to cash in on the latest indie trend of 2009.
There are some excellent YouTube tutorials on how to Data Mosh using free, open-source software.
Check them out, and try making some psychedelic videos of your own.
Maybe, just maybe, if the effect keeps being popularized through creative work,
There'll be no one left to take the conspiracy mongers seriously.

But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids.
A pharmacy in Sarasota is refusing to sell a non-homeopathic cold remedy to a pregnant, atheist, transitional fossil.

Hi
I'm Alan Melikdajangpohjsdfkhasdksd, creator of Captain Disillusion.
I hope you don't mind me pulling back the curtain on the movie magic this one time
To let you know how grateful I am that so many of you watch my weird videos.
Seeing a growing list of over
58,000 subscribers getting so excited every time I post something new, makes me feel very happy...and also pretty guilty because
We all know I haven't been posting videos as often as I should.
But I'm here to tell you that that has now changed.
This year, I've made a pledge
to post a video every single month, at least!
And you can always keep track of this fact and know exactly when the next video is coming through a countdown on the Captain disillusion
website.
Now, I want to make it clear
that this isn't because a company is now sponsoring me or a studio is producing this as a webseries
It's still just me making videos in my spare time.
I'm just making a concerted effort to bring you more because you deserve it.
I've also taken the advice so many of you have given me on Facebook and Twitter and joined Patreon.
Patreon is a website that lets viewers like you become patrons of your favorite independent artists like me,
by supporting them through crowdfunding.
It's a great system that's existed since the beginning of civilization.
Leonardo Da Vinci had some Patrons
and that's how he was able to create some of the most inspiring works in history like the Mona Lisa or his...
early concept drawing for a weapon of mass murder.
Imagine what you and I can do if we made it possible for Captain Disillusion to eventually be my full-time job.
Now whether you choose to be a patron or not
I'm still making these videos and,
Since I'm doing it monthly now there's going to be a lot of extra content that might not be interesting to a casual viewer.
but it makes for perfect Patreon rewards for fans that choose to support me.
So if you look at the bottom of my patreon profile, you'll see the different tiers of support
you can sign up for and depending on what you choose, you can get access to behind-the-scenes footage
bloopers and outtakes, secret posts about what videos I'm working on next, high-resolution downloads of artwork from the animated segments
and if you're a fellow Youtuber or a filmmaker
I'm also posting video tutorials about how I do some of my production and visual effects so that you can apply them to your own projects.
There's a whole bunch of other rewards you can read about on the profile page.
If you sign up, and you change your mind later
You can always cancel at any point
Or you can do like a community thing and you can cancel but then come back again
And then cancel and come back--all I ask is that you check it out for the sake of rational thinking,
skepticism, the love of visual effects, geeky movie references, and a friend of mine named Captain Disillusion.
[Captain D]: So you've finally sold out.
[Alan]: No I'm just trying to get--
[Captain D]: You sold out.
[Alan]: *unintelligible* support from my viewers.
[Captain D]: And you actually think
[Captain D]: people are going to want--
[Alan]: *defending self*
*arguing*
[Captain D]: *Insulting Alan*
[Alan]: I'm-i'm over--I'm not gonna listen to this anymore
[Alan]: I don't have to listen to you anymore!
[Alan]: NO!"

Greetings Children, Captian Disillusion is my name...
...and debunking fake paranormal videos is my game.
But ya know, at the end of the day...
this is just a job.
I'm also a person with...with interests and hobbies.
Let's... let's get to know each other a little bit.
Let's bond.
Come on... we can talk about anything.
Female voice: Please focus your gaze on the topic of conversation you prefer.
You like cars? Me too!
I love 'em!
All kinds of cars!
Big ones... small ones...
The hatch...back.
The uh...
what's the one ... t-the logo is a thing inside a circle?
[cricket chirping]
I especially love...
...when my hobby...
...cars...
...intersects with my work...
...explaining weird stuff.
As is the case with some of these
crazy Russian dashboard camera videos.
You see, in Russia...
...everyone has a video camera running in their car.
A fad started by Emperor Constantine...
...a noted voyeur, during his brief reign in 1825.
Okay, not really, but...
...it does end up capturing some remarkable moments.
Such as the Chelyabinsk meteor in 2013.
And then there's this bizarre traffic sighting:
The Russian Ghost Car!
While making a routine turn in an intersection...
...some drivers are cut off by a car
that springs up out of nowhere.
Causing the mildest accident of all time.
[faint screaming]
That's really weird though.
Where did it come from?
What's going on here?
Well...
Let me explain.
Only I won't be the first.
There are some explanations floating around but...
...they're all kind of...
flawed in my opinion.
People think there's lights behind the tram...
...or that those distant cars are relevant...
...or that everything was a 90s CGI cartoon.
ReBoot!
But we all agree that basically what happened...
...was a real life optical illusion.
You know, when you're walking down a street...
...and a cool person coming the other way
is behind a pole...
...and you just never get to see their beautiful face...
...because you're both moving?
[OHGODWHY]
That's what happened.
The ghost car was always there.
It ran a red light from the oncoming lane...
...next to the tram...
...and was obscured from our view
by the car in front...
...until that car stopped.
You can actually see a brief glimpse
of the rear of the ghost car...
...before it emerges.
You can also verify its trajectory...
...from the light cast by its headlights.
Not what's seen through the windshield...
...in fact, that side's not even headlights,
but a reflection of the sky.
But the light under the car tells us a lot.
The shadow of the tires diffuse at first...
...due to the long row of distant headlights.
...then it gets sharper...
...as a single light source approaches.
The change in the shadow beams with an angle...
...guides us directly to
where ghost car's front bumper is...
...until it emerges.
But wait! - you say.
What are the chances that cars of similar size...
...could obscure each other so perfectly...
...for so long?
And if the ghost car was in the oncoming lane...
...why does it appear at such a weird angle?
And why the hell would this person run a red light...
...in the traffic, after it's been red forever?!
To which I say:
WHY DO YOU GOTTA ASK
SO MANY GODDAMN QUESTIONS?
I'll tackle the size issue first...
...most of these dashboard cameras...
...are tiny things, with very wide angle lenses.
You don't wanna miss any part...
...of the Oscar worthy ensurance fraud performances.
But it also means...
...that the lines of perspective are exaggerated.
It only takes a few feet for something
to from tiny to full screen.
It's really easy for things to obscure other things.
As to why the driver ran the red light...
...well, let's think about what this lane is.
It's the equivalent of our lane on the opposite side.
And we're turning left.
He must also be seeing green to turn left.
But he decided he wants to straight for some reason.
Maybe he was confused...
...by the tastefully understated
European turn signal.
USE AN ARROW!
And for him the first passing car...
...obscures all of us...
...just he's obscure from us
by the car in front.
At the last moment he slowes down
and swerves to avoid the front car...
...but clips its headlight.
And that's why the angle is what it is.
It's probably not the first time
this happened at this intersection.
In fact, if you enhance the sound...
...which no one bothered to do...
...you can hear the guy and girl in our car...
...talking Russian, making reference to some
local traffic safety problems at the beginning:
There's also this awesome exchange,
after the accident:
So that's it!
All aspects of the mystery had been solved, I think...
Unless...
OHMYGOD, there's no one in the car!
And to think we wouldn't learn about
such interesting optical illusions...
...if it wasn't for all the Russian dashcams...
...fighting widespread police corruption
and insurance fraud...
...brought on by economic turmoil
engineered by Vladimir Putin...
...under strict instructions from
the New World Order...
...administered by the Illuminati.
Thanks Illuminati! :3
Or should I say...
[undescribable Illuminati talk
while D turns into a reptilian]
Thanks Tostitos®
by FritoLay!
Or should I say...

Greetings Children!
*Exhaling exasperatedly*
I-I am beside myself.
If you recall, last time I deconstructed the popular ""Miss Ping"" video.
Well the creators responded, in full force!
They tried to prove me wrong by re-making the video using a more voluptuous girl and all the same techniques with slight alterations.
And to show how confident they are they published the new video at half the resolution of the original.
This is now a matter of honor.
I vow that I will not rest until I've debunked every single- *gasp as beeping is heard*
I almost forgot!
It's not too late.
We don't wanna miss this.
A comet.
Not just any comet.
A viral comet.
You see, most viral videos burst into social consciousness and then disappear just as quickly into the annals of pop culture history.
Leaving us to wonder what we ever liked about the Numa Numa kid or planking.
But some videos mostly ones about fake accidents, conspiracies, or alternative medicine claims come back again and again.
Take for instance the truck saves plane video, this astonishing news excerpt shows a daring rescue of a plane whos landing gear is jammed.
It's been around for years, and is obviously fake, but continues to be posted by random people and believed by random others.
Join me on ""The Ship of Outrage"" to explore the ridiculousness of this, and other, Viral Comets.
To understand the nature of this viral comet we must go back in time to the moment of its birth in the year of our lord, twenty hundred and eleven.
*yells comedically as he falls*
Even back then when the video first appeared there were those who questioned its authenticity.
(Non-believer)""This video is an illusion""
But the powerful majority of un-discerning viewers disagreed.
(Powerful majority of un-discerning viewers)""Blasphemy!
All internet videos are real!
Recant! Or face punishment for your skepticism""
(Non-believer)""I will do no such thing, it is fake and you would see this too... if only you'd open your eyes.
The plane, she has no airline markings. Just like the news graphics have no station ID!
The Contrast of the plane and its shadow is visibly different from the background.
All the people look like Costco catalog models, and even though they are describing a harrowing near-death experience from minutes earlier
They speak with the ease and clarity of an infomercial testimonial, lit perfectly at an airport terminal.
The hero guy pimps the trucks technical features and the truck itself looks like a shiny showroom vehicle...
after a freaking 400 ton plane smashed onto it!
And also, there's a disclaimer at the very begining that says the whole thing is not real. What are you stupid?""
(Powerful majority of un-discerning viewers)""Oh snap!""
It's just a grass roots viral ad. Originally posted on an innocent YouTube channel by the multi-national advertising agency, TBWA.
But you won't find it there now.
The campaign is long over and a crazy plane accident is no longer ""on message"" for Nissan.
But do a search and you'll probably see the video posted as recently as a couple months ago by some random user. Real or not, it's a lasting viral hit.
And we all need a little dose of ""attention"" every now and then.
Oh yeah. That's the stuff.
But I wouldn't get too hung up on the fact that people repost the video as their own. You see, this ad itself is not original.
It's premise and main visual set piece already existed in another video posted on the web back in 2000.
It's an independent short film entitled ""405"".
A funny and exciting action piece about an airliner making an emergency landing on top of an unsuspecting SUV.
And it advertises... nothing.
It's just cool and creative. What took dozens of executive account co-executive associate producers in charge of executive accounts hundreds
of thousands of dollars to create by hiring the visual effects vendor of ""Firefly"" and ""Battlestar Galactica""
Was done more convincingly, and in a more entertaining way by a couple of indie film makers in three months on their home computers a decade earlier.
But the life cycle of a web meme is always the same... ""405"" is arguably the worlds first successful internet viral video.
Having been seen and shared by millions five years before YouTube was even conceived.
And even though both its creators went on to careers in visual effects, the film became just another viral comet.
Obscure enough for a corporation to completely lift its idea for a commercial while random YouTube users continue to post it as their own.
Some even collecting ad revenue which I don't think goes to the film makers.
All of this can be avoided if you make it a habit to always go to the source.
When you see an interesting video trending, don't follow the clickbait link to an embedded player and cite some pointless blog article.
""Present company excluded""
Instead, search for it yourself and go to the oldest existing post. You're more likely to find the original creator.
Reward them with your views.
And see the video in its original context. Or you might find something even better.
Then relax take a deep breath-
*loud inhale, choking sounds, then gulp*
-and enjoy the creativity.
*outro music begins playing*
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids, a graduate student in Wyoming is browsing the Templeton Foundation's website.

Greetings children, Captain Disillusion here.
Viral marketing is a disgusting sounding, but fascinating thing.
It's complicated, yet laughably predictable.
Whether you're advertising a product or promoting your own web series of crazy stunts with a
quirky name like, I don't know, Tumba Ping Pong Show, getting views is hard.
You slave away producing clever stunt videos for months,
collecting modest hits by modern standards.
And then it hits you. Put a somber blond bird on it
The numbers speak for themselves.
Not to take anything away from the substance of the video,
which features astonishing precision knife throwing and catching using ping pong paddles.
It's an impressive looking stunt that has viewers all over the web scratching their heads,
and bandaging their fingers. It looks dangerous, but is 100% faked.
*glass breaking sound effect*
I will show you exactly how they did it
right... now.
But first let's take a moment to talk about our sponsor:
This week's Captain Disillusion is brought to you by knives.
They cut...
and they don't ask no ***ing questions.
And now back to the show.
Like my uncle used to say,
life would be a lot easier if you could make things invisible, and with visual effects you can!
By cloning pixels of the surrounding area to paint away an object.
But doing it frame by frame in a long video is time-consuming
so you have to be clever and keep those digital invisibility moments to a minimum.
Miss Ping flips her paddles at the moment
they're struck by the knives not for extra flair
but because the knives are in the paddles the whole time.
And it's simpler to erase the smaller knife tips from the plain gray surfaces.
This is the reason for the offbeat choreography.
She begins with the paddles hidden, and incidentally with a ping-pong ball inside her mouth for later.
Then turns quickly, exposing the side view of the paddles
for only a few frames making for less erasing work.
Unfortunately one of the knives grazed her skirt, and that's not so easy to get rid of.
Once she's in position, Mr. Slightly-Mad Max displays some real knives.
He then proceeds to serve them to his paddle, but in reality

a Captain D's Bang Be Gone sound dampening blanket.

Watch as these knives defy the laws of physics,
gliding into proper position to be struck.
What you're really seeing is a transition to fake,
composited images of thrown knives, whose carefully keyframed motion-blurred
outlines are only onscreen for a handful of frames to guide your eyes to the other real knives
waiting in Miss Ping's paddles.
Same deal with the ping-pong ball at the very end. Real ball steal,
fake ball pass, real ball mouth reveal.
During the big pineapple finish you don't even see the digitally composited knife land.
You only hear the sound, which they captured separately likely right on location for added authenticity.
*knife landing*
*gasps*
But that's not the part we care about. How did the CG knife slice the very obviously real pineapple?
Granted, we only have a highly compressed internet video to work with, but even here,
with a lot of processing, and very little social life, we can spot the oldest trick in the book...
A string.
Confucius was right,
a pre-cut half of a pineapple yanked off by fishing line at just the right moment
can impress two and a half million internet users.
Man, strings. They never get old.
Well, I hope you learned something.
In the world of viral marketing, performing an unbelievable stunt on video will get you far.
Faking one and doing it well will get you further still.
Faking it mediocrely, but with the right distraction, will get you to the top.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids.

Captain Disillusion!
*glass breaking*"
"
Okay, okay. Here we go. Greetings children. It's me Captain Disillusion and you're...
You're not so little anymore, are you?
I know it's been a while and uh...
You're probably thinking
You've learned it all, huh?
Green screens, motion tracking, digital augmentation of real footage obscured by low resolution.
Thanks Captain D. We get how it works now, we don't need you anymore.
Well you're wrong.
New imaging techniques are developed all the time: deep compositing,
computational photography... You gotta stay informed.
Because just knowing that any video can be faked these days is a double-edged sword.
It can sometimes lead you to conclude that a slightly implausible video is fake, when it just might be real.
Or might'n it?
Guy builds a Star Trek phaser
There are several videos like this featuring DIY enthusiasts
outfitting prop phaser guns with real laser diodes.
Pretty cool.
Except we've all played with laser pointers, and we know that you can see the point but not the beam.
Unless it's traveling through a translucent medium, like smoke,
which is in fact exactly what this guy filled the room with, but not everyone is convinced.
«So have people really established that this is for real?»
«The beam looks way perfect, just like the shows for me, but I could be wrong.»
«I mean, wouldn't this be all over the news?»
Okay, nevermind YouTube comments, but we all know that Facebook comments are for real
I don't want a name drop but a pretty prominent skeptical podcaster is adamant
that this video has been faked.
«There's no laser beam in the world as wide and bright as that one.»
«At least not without a power supply the size of a building.»
«He may have put a small laser into it, but the beam in this video has been majorly enhanced.»
«I say it was fully animated on top of whatever existing beam would have been visible.»
Valid points. But just in case, let's hear from an expert in the field.
THAT'S WHOM YOU ARE THE SON OF!
- Uh? Wh- what's happening? 
- Hi, Mr. Flare?
- Question: 
- (Oh, it's you)
- as a dues-paying member of the electromagnetic spectrum,
- (Yes)
- can you, uh... ""enlighten"" us
- (You got fat)
about this video? Is the laser real or has it been faked somehow?
Lasers... You think I know about lasers... 
Of course! We're all the same aren't we?
""Oh, he's a flickering green lens flare. He must know everything about freaking blue lasers!""
Do you understand your own corporeal privilege?!
Yeah, I'm just gonna shuck and jive for you, master,
- and tell you all about my brothers the blue l-
- Okay, okay...
Thank you.
I guess the only way to get to the truth is a uh...
marginally scientific experiment
First we construct an exact replica of the garage from the video. This will be left empty. It's our control.
Then we build another copy of the garage which we fill with fog,
using the same kind of fog machine as in the video.
And while I could totally also build a perfect phaser replica,
I'm not going to for copyright reasons.
But I will use the same kind of 1000 mW blue laser diode that they often put in these models. Ready?
Fire in the hole!
Now if you can hear me through the fake sound effect added in post,
the beam is clearly visible and just like in the video it can pop balloons.
In fact, it even kind of works without smoke. 
In fact fact, it even works outside in the daylight.
The only time it doesn't seem to work very well is when you're not looking through a camera.
Look: the beam is faded and hair-thin.
What does this mean?
It has to do with exposure and contrast curves.
Unfiltered camera imaging sensors can actually see farther into the ultraviolet and infrared
parts of the spectrum than the human eye.
It's why the invisible emitter of a remote control may show up on video
and why some early camcorders with night vision mode used to see through clothes.
But human vision still vastly outperforms a sensor when it comes to light sensitivity and dynamic range.
An unlit interior space might look like this to the naked eye
but this is the way it looks to the raw sensor of a camera.
So we have to do all kinds of exposure tricks just to make it look normal.
We open up the aperture and electronically amplify the brightness of the image with gain or ISO settings.
And keep in mind that most consumer camcorders on auto mode do this on their own.
But once we've compensated and made the overall scene look brighter,
the truly bright objects become super bright and bloomed on the image.
So Christmas lights look like burning stars.
Light bulbs look like plasma torches and laser beams can look... like phaser beams.
So there you have it.
It was real but inadvertently enhanced by the nature of video technology.
(And in a way,)
- (no one was technically wrong.)
- I thought I turned you off.
- Ya sure do!
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go, kids. A student in Wichita
got one of these lasers, and didn't wear the safety goggles!
Love with your heart, use your head for everything else!
Captain Disillusion!"
"
*intro*
Hey! Captain D here.
In a utility closet of a residential kitchen to prove a point.
Family homes are where most poltergeist activities usually reported
Poltergeist are supposed to be these unseen spirits that try to get you to leave the house or otherwise get your attention by...
[cups hitting the cabinets and floor]
...throwing stuff around like some sort of invisible girlfriend.
But unlike a girlfriend, poltergeist don't seem to mind if you film them in action.
YouTube is chock-full of poltergeist videos and even whole channels dedicated to them.
Like this one called: ""mellowb-1-rd"".
That might be ""mellowbird"".
Anyway, people constantly send me links to these primitive clips asking for an explanation...
...and some even have the audacity to suggest:
(mockingly) ""Hey Captain Disillusion, why don't you make a fake video of your own and post it anonymously and it gets popular and you can reveal it was you.""
Please.
I don't do that.
I explain things.
Now, take a good look and you'll see that any poltergeist video that actually shows things moving and falling is always shot with a stationary camera.
The usual excuse is, of course, that the person left the camera in the room for a long time to capture the paranormal activity.
But at the same time, a still shot with no people in it is fodder for all kinds of digital manipulation.
I mean, you can step into the shot, rig things up to fall, then step out and set the rigs off.
[more cups falling]
Do it again and again with other objects.
Later, you can edit the parts with you out and, because the background never changes, it'll be seamless.
With a little more effort and some editing software, you can do things like, erase strings or even your hand, by replacing the area with pixels from the empty shot.
Knowing the principle, you're free to go wild...
[noise of falling objects]
...shoving and tossing and launching and breaking things as lazily and as violently as you can.
[more noise of falling objects]
I mean that's what these exes do, right?
The bigger the mess, the creepier it looks.
As if a poltergeist could do any better.
My point is simple.
The basic principle is always the same
Once you know-
[weird noise]
Did you cut?
Cameraman: No.
CD: C-come
What's going on here?
Guys, this isn't funny.
H-how did this happen?
We were just here.
I made a mess of this...
[more noise of falling objects]
...I threw these things down.
[falling debris]
[container hitting counter]
Did this, I stepped out here for a second and came back-
Oh my god!"
"
Hey! Captain D here. I'm away on a mission and because apparently you can't live without me,
I'm transmitting from the field during a quiet moment.
A little... too quiet.
Like the beginning of one of those pop-up videos. I hate pop-up videos
I'm not talking about ads or the VH1 kind your grandma probably told you about -- I'm talking about these:
Web videos are Flash animations, sometimes called screamers, that show you something calm to get your guard down and then
scare the shoes off you with an abrupt scary image.
And have you noticed that whether it's an alien, the Exorcist girl,
or whatever else it's always a face. Why?
Because the same mechanism in the brain that eagerly tries to make you see the face of Jesus
on an exploded tire tread tries to help you recognize a real face faster than anything else.
So when that flashing face is enraged or deformed, you basically know that something's horribly wrong before you even know it.
Add to that a jarring sound that also affects your base instincts, and you've got yourself a good old-fashioned trouser-soaker.
It's like a lightning bolt that strikes directly into your subconscious, and it can do some real damage to a young mind.
Trillions of children are affected by the menace of screamer pop-ups every second of every day
Sometimes twice because they click it and watch it again, but it doesn't have to be this way.
Take a stand, arm yourself and your loved ones against pop-up videos.
First, always watch suspicious videos for the first time without sound.
If it's a pop-up video the impact will be cut in half,
and this is something you should be doing with paranormal videos in general if you want to be good at detecting visual trickery.
And second, take this digital vaccine I've created to immunize you against common pop-up faces
By watching them gently appear and fade away in this slideshow,
your mind will retain a memory of the monsters, so that they won't be as terrifying if seen again, okay?
Ok--
I'm sorry.
Just kidding.
I love doing that.
Well, if you're not completely traumatized, you should now be ready to face the world of web video with newfound courage.
And I gotta go... it's happening. Love with your heart, use your head for everything else.
[Screeching]
Take that!"

Greetings children, Captain Disillusion here
Times are changing
This year the first 3D television channel goes online in America
Of course, it's from ESPN and will broadcast exclusively sporting events like football games
because if there's one thing you need to see an exquisite detail of all three dimensions
It's a bunch of dudes smashing into each other
But it is a wake up call
Web video is a competitive field and one has to keep up
I realize that if I'm going to compete with the many
professional video bloggers coming at you in trendy jump cuts from their living rooms
So I have to do something really special
So-
I have gone 3D
woooh
And I've mastered state of the art '70s green screen technology
*clap clap*
So you don't have to get bored while I talk
But most importantly I've learned to analyze view statistics
so that I can cater my content to the audience, and maximize exposure and profitability
So um...
Why don't you uh,
take a little break out on the patio,
ladies age 18 to 44
Because the other 86% of my demographic and I have a few Manly topics to discuss
*fist noise*
Like football!
That's right
Now you've all been requesting this video for a really long time,
So let's do it!
psyChe!
To the extreme!
Gentlemen, I give you
NFL fantasy files
The super popular compilation of videos
features star football players performing unbelievable stunts in practice
in an effort to persuade you to pick them for your fantasy football league,
but turns out it's an award-winning viral video campaign for Reebok and nfl.com
designed and produced by a New York City-based creative agency called Blue Room.
They used some badass invisible special effects to make celebrity athletes look cool-er.
The campaign proved so successful, they make a series of fantasy files clips every year
but a certain bunch have gone mega Viral and withstood the test of time.
Now as good as these professional athletes are, they're not capable of defying probability and the laws of physics
Whoa!
But, the clever and subtle visual effects used to achieve these daring illusions are fun to decipher
So let's take a look at some highlights:
CUT 1
Chris Cooley positions himself behind the wall
but the swish pan from the pass serves as a transition
to a shot of Cooley behind the wall where a violent looking hole has already been pre-cut.
A simple digital touch-up masked the hole in the few frames where it's visible prior to impact
Cooley thrusts his hand through the hole, and an elegant animation of dust and debris does the rest.
Note the dust disappearing completely before the camera starts to reposition.
A moment  later the football is placed in Cooley's hand though a clean background plate is used to hide this fact
and Cooley emerges victorious
CUT 2
Jason Campbell on the field.
He throws a pass then another almost two seconds later which miraculously catches up to the first
But in fact the real footballs land downfield masked by the match moved background plate
while two computer-generated footballs bump and fall into the hands of the receivers
who stand motionless to make the animators job just a little easier
CUT 3
Marcus Colston in practice
Settles in a steady shot from which a clean background plate is generated.
He pretends to catch balls handed to him much like during the game- What?!
That joke brought to you by the little swishes that made it look like a football slew in from frame right
CUT 4
Marc Bulger -and here's where things get tricky.
He throws a pass right into a swish zoom transition
to a separate shot of the bulky gentleman where the yard marker is hid by someone else from a much closer distance.
The zoom out retains the guy from the close up until Colston's bodies digitally wipes him away and
this amazing play is repeated twice more.
CUT 5
Back to basics with Chris Chambers, the fanboys mime throwing passes
letting their footballs drop to the ground behind them as Chambers does the dance
complete with close range ball on ball action
The momentary cover is enough for most of us to forget that the practice footballs at the fanboys feet are the
very same ones they pretended to throw.
CUT 6
A truly classic play with Mason Crosby
using a classic digital wire renewal technique originally developed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic back in the early '90s.
The real balls go one way, the CG balls go another and so it goes.
And finally,
CUT 7
Laurence Moroney passes in front of a real SUV. As he hustles and gets ready,
the vehicle is quietly driven just out of range.
Moroney launches ahead and does a precise dive and roll onto a mat on the lawn. In this key moment, all
activities paused and the SUV is rolled back into position.
The camera captures a full reference shot of the car and then, on command, action is resumed.
Later a compositing geek spends a night intricately marrying the image of the car into the footage of
Maroney's jump complete with shadows, transparency, and a nearly invisible morph transition into the final real shot.
Simply amazing
Ladies and gentlemen this breakdown is blessing you by the great taste of Disillusiables Chunky Matter. What's the matter? It's Disillusiables.
*boom*
You know what, this isn't right. This whole thing just doesn't feel right.
I always tell you not to make uninformed assumptions,
but in my zeal to be successful, I turn around and do that very thing.
I assumed that every single one of you has two properly functioning eyes to enjoy a 3D episode and that's probably not the case.
I assume that view counts and
demographic stats are accurate and reliable and they're not always
worst of all, I assumed that
simply summing up what average viewers expect and serving it up to you will make you happy
But I'm not so average. And if you like me, maybe you're not so average either
I'm sorry, I stereotyped you, but don't worry. I'll keep doing what I do. The way I like to do it.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids. A 4th grader in Pasadena. Just realized she's not...
average and is freaking out. I can't help feeling responsible.
Remember: Love with your heart use your head for everything else

PENN JILLETTE: I mean, I still wanna keep testing this, 'cause I don't really know.
But I really don't think in most cases, and maybe in all, that the secrets matter at all.
CAPTAIN DISILLUSION: So, let's test it and correct Derren's error with a proper and, to date, most detailed
explanation of the Lottery prediction trick.
(GUNSHOT)
Technically, Derren didn't predict anything.
DERREN BROWN: The BBC have a legal right to announce the lottery numbers first,
Because of that I can't show you the numbers until just after the lottery has been announced.
CAPTAIN DISILLUSION: That makes no sense, it's not illegal to announce your guess of the lottery numbers,
Especially if you're not even playing.
But anyway, a full thirty seconds pass after the results are announced by the BBC,
And before Darren shows you a rack of balls with the correct numbers on them.
All this required was to ensure that those known numbers are on the balls by the time he turns them.
And this was achieved with a video effect which could be labelled, 'Split-Screen',
But this is an oversimplification. It's actually a lot more involved than that.
During the single, continuous shot in which the trick is performed a pre-recorded patch of the set is faded in,
Allowing an assistant to enter the shot and replace the correct balls as they're being announced on TV,
And then faded out allowing Derren Brown to enter the area and display his balls.
This effect would have been pretty simple to achieve, even in the early days of TV,
If the camera had been locked off and steady,
But in this case we're made to believe that the camera is handheld and jerking around,
Which would've made it impossible to match a pre-recorded piece of footage to it.
And this is what's at the heart of the realism of this trick;
This movement isn't digital.
You can see the perspective distortion as the wide angle lens rotates around.
So how was it done?
Let's start from the beginning.
Darren begins his presentation outside of the set and walks in,
This was necessary to accommodate an important switch.
A switch from a live camera man to a different means of camera support.
A motion control, pan and tilt system, in which the panning, tilting and zooming is controlled robotically.
Though they're highly specialized and expensive equipment,
These systems are widely available and used in television to remotely control cameras on large sets,
And to facilitate camera movement with virtual sets.
Operated with a joystick, gears or a virtual panhead,
Motion control systems can precisely record an operator's movements and recreate them later.
In fact, it looks like two of these systems were used in the trick.
One controlled the wobbly camera capturing these brief wide shots,
In which the second system, positioned and ready for the main shot,
Is hidden with yet another patch image of the empty set.
By examining frames from the main shot before and after this cutaway,
We can see the obvious differences in the angle.
And after the cutaway, the camera shakes no longer have any bank rotation.
It pans and tilts, but stays perfectly balanced throughout.
Before Darrin's broadcast ever began several minutes of an empty set were filmed,
with random camera movements fed into the motion control system which recorded them.
Then, during the broadcast, not only was pre-recorded footage of the set played on part of the screen
But pre-recorded camera motion was played into the camera mount in precise sync.
Creating a seamless, 'live' moving composite.
When the assistant was safely out of shot, the image patch was faded out.
Immediately after that, the camera head was disengaged from the pre-recorded motion,
And a human operator took over the controls to zoom in on the final angle.
So, to review.
DERREN BROWN: It's been fantastic reading all the conspiracies and speculations around at the moment.
Lasers writing numbers onto the balls and moving them somehow,
And split-screens, and balls with special LED readouts and impossible sleight of hand.
CAPTAIN DISILLUSION: An ingenious, elegant union of technology and showmanship that Derren promised to share,
But instead passed off as pseudo-scientific, mentalist drivel with a coy disclaimer at the very end.
DERREN BROWN: So if I'm ever asked how I predicted the lottery I'm going to say,
""It was just a trick.""
CAPTAIN DISILLUSION: And that you lied to the nation to promote your TV show, right?
Sorry.
Now isn't the trick just as impressive now even though you know the explanation?
Isn't that more interesting than listening to nonsense about, 'The Wisdom of the Crowd'?
I think so.
In a way, this is what critical thinking is all about;
Learning as much accurate information about the world around you as you can,
So that you may truly appreciate it for its beauty and complexity, as it really is.

Please welcome Mr. Flare
Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
Undiscovered interdimensional particles of organic matter I don't know about you
But I wasn't entirely convinced by Captain Disillusion's watered down
pantry Ghosts Debunk
And I'm not one to blow idly by while someone might be wrong on the internet
It took a shining beacon of intellect like me to figure out the truth. Okay, I flickered in CD's
Face till he gave up and reexamined the pantry ghost videos
but when he did he had an epiph-
an epinth- an epiphan- he realized the original explanation wasn't entirely correct
So now here to present the real answers the guy who screwed up in the first place
the man of a thousand faces
The chrome crusader of critical thinking- [Capt. D] Yeah ok All right. Thank you very much. I think you've done more than enough.
[Mr. Flare] Captain Disillusion! Sorry.
[Capt. D] Now then let's try this one more time
The broad strokes of the Illusion are still the same. It is a real girl
And it is a physical effect achieved for the most part in camera and there really are pantries with hidden compartments
But such a structure is not needed to summon this particular ghost
the Shelves of this pantry are
inset in such a way that there is some space behind the door
As well as to the sides as can be seen in ""Ghost Makes Contact""
Studying these slightly enhanced repeat passes of the appearances and ""Real Ghost Video Proof 2""
we can pretty much see exactly what's happening the girl presses her face and palms against the glass then steps to the side and
crouches down
There was the evidence all along staring us in the face and shifting around apparently
But what about the other clips where we see the bottom space well?
Jeremy the creator of the videos got more crafty with each new clip in
""Real Ghost Video Proof 3"" the door opens to reveal the shelves top to bottom but we don't quite see the right side.
The girl is hiding there after pushing the bottom part of the door, the same as always, probably with her foot.
Jeremy walks up careful not to reveal the right side and closes the door.
The ghost makes her appearance. After that she pulls back, dips down, and hides under the bottom shelf once again
Jeremy thrusts the door open
but conveniently avoids catching the area below the bottom shelf and
during this brief time the girl simply crawls out of the pantry and out of shot before Jeremy finally tilts down.
In ""Ghost Makes Contact"" he uses the same basic technique
But adds an extra twist. First of all John is obviously a stooge as evidenced by this
Dramatic moment in the ""Mabel Real Ghost: The Documentary Trailer""
[John, faking annoyance] You have one minute!
[Capt. D] Come on. Now on what is apparently day 10 after the ghost makes her appearance and the door opens
It's a toss-up between her hiding in the side again
and then sneaking out behind John's somewhat choreographed entrance or
Jeremy getting even more tech-savvy and patching up a small part of the image with empty frames to allow the girl to crawl out.
This isn't so difficult when you consider that the camera
Conveniently remain still on a tripod just long enough for that to happen and I being partial to digital effects
I'm going to give Jeremy the benefit of the doubt and opt for that possibility.
So the shelves of the pantry didn't swivel because they didn't need to there was enough space there to begin with.
And Arianna is it? She fit right in.
Ironically it was all about the moments when the ghost wasn't seen
Now that that's settled. Where were we?
It's Vegas"

*Drumroll*
Greetings, children, Captain Disillusion here. Let's talk about
fauna.
Not your Aunt Fauna, but fauna, the animal world.
Do you know what controls the behavior of animals like, say, sharks?
[Disembodied voice] I do.
Uh oh.
[Explosion]
*woosh*
I control the animals, the people, and everything else in the universe- even the random stuff.
Holy cr-
It's pronounced Holly! But you would forget a thing like that, wouldn't you, D?
What are you doing here?
It's almost Valentine's Day, and I thought a certain someone might like to shower me with gifts.
You know, a sacrificial lamb or two?
Kids, Holly, here, has what's called,
""delusions of grandeur.""
How dare you?
after all we've been through together?
Woah, woah. Let's get something straight:
We were never together.
Oh, come now.
It's a beautiful story. I've always been with you. I was there when you were born.
[Holly] You were the cutest little baby in the universe.
I breathed, and you awoke.
And at that moment I realized I am the reason you exist
And we're meant for each other
That's not how I remember it at all
Years ago, I was hanging out at a party with some friends
And one of them goes,
""Yo. Check that out.""
*Upbeat music begins*
And I'll admit. I was intrigued.
[Holly] Aww...
But I quickly realized that it would never work out.
What?!
You're intolerable!
*shoots laser*
*explosion*
I am awesome! I'm all-knowing and omnipotent. Name one thing about me that isn't perfect.
Are you kidding me?
You have a problem communicating.
You never call; you always text. I mean, what's that about? And the text messages all contradict each other.
You love making up rules for things people know to do anyway, and you get so angry about the slightest little
infractions while major world problems don't seem to concern you at all.
I- I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's just my way. It's all part of a plan.
And you say that you have a plan- that you know what you're doing-
but you never seem to, and when stuff goes wrong. It's always somehow everybody else's fault.
It's not true!
You're paranoid, vindictive, and controlling, except you don't really control anything. And the answer to my previous question is not you,
it's instinct. Instinct is what controls the behavior of animals and everyone and me, but I also
have a rational mind
You say that now, but when life gets hard,
when the weight of the world is too much to bear, you'll come crawling back to Holly.
Unlikely. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a video to deconstruct.
You know, CD, If you're not careful, you're gonna lose me.
What? I never had you! Are you mental?
*sigh*
Where was I?
Sharks! Ev-
Ever surfed one?
In this popular video, a gnarly thrill seeker lures a shark with pieces of meat,
and then uses it as a tow boat while he surfs
Whoa, that looks incredibly dangerous. That guy and his brand-name gear must be totally awesome.
But, like with Holly,
appearances can be deceiving
It's an awfully nice quality wetsuit. Almost makes me want to buy one.
*glass breaking*
But let's not get distracted. The video is a hoax.
Notice how it gets away with never actually showing a real shark at all.
All I see is a generic fin, and when after a conspicuous
transition, this fin begins to travel in front of a propelled surfer,
I see a sizable wake from a water vehicle traveling a few feet ahead
Honestly, why would a shark, caught on the hook of a monster fishing pole, panicked and in pain, travel steadily along the
water surface in a straight line parallel to the beach, and why would this be so...
...mildly exciting to onlookers and even the people floating in the water just a few feet away from the action? These are many questions...
...with just one answer:
The video is part of a viral marketing campaign of a company selling eyewear for people active in sports.
It's one of several clips, all of which use a combination of physical and digital effects to weird you out and flash the product.
Now, wait a minute.
According to my research, ...
...this company is part of this company, which also owns this company, ...
...which got these guys to do this, and this and all of that!
It's a conspiracy.
Yeah, a conspiracy to protect your eyes from UV radiation in style.
Um... never mind.
It's a nicely done viral clip, no question, but there's something unsettling
about such a subliminal method of advertising.
And besides, with a reality-style video presented totally out of
context, there's always going to be some kook who attempts it for real, and when the Shark is chomping on his board, ...
...who is he going to call upon to rescue him? I think we know, but who's gonna actually have to do the rescuing?
I rest my case.
Now I'm afraid it's time for me to go, kids, but I implore you: love with your heart, but use your head for everything else.
Captain Disillusion!"
"
Greetings children! Captain D here. I'd like to speak to you about the very serious subject of inbreeding.
You see, ancient royal families and small isolated mountain communities
Have long suffered from serious genetic disorders because they tend to repeatedly mate with people within their own family
But I'm talking about psychological inbreeding. Which is a term
I made up, just now, to describe groups of people who conspire to believe in the same myths.
They spew superstitions and
conspiracy theories at each other until it all coagulates into a set of specific brand name BS.
Bigfoot Orbs, the Illuminati and the Grey are examples of this and the latter are the subject of today's video.
Bush: ...reaffirm the vital place of home ownership in our nation.
CD: This isn't the newest video in the pile,
but it needs to be addressed. In a broadcast of President Bush speaking in the Rose Garden,
someone has observed a mysterious alien figure standing in the window directly behind him.
And although it seems the poster wasn't serious, many took the bait.
You see? There's its head, eyes,
mouth, body, hand and also this! Which is...
O-of course. A green spirit jumping out of the alien.
This is a recurring type of alien commonly known as a Grey. Because... it's naked. And grey.
So naturally upon seeing this the question that arises on most people's minds is:
""Is Bush being controlled by the Greys?""
Mmm, it would explain a lot.
Bush: ...not the government's job to bail out speculators.
If you're watching this in the year
2023 (and I think you are) George W. Bush has been out of office as U.S. President for 15 years.
But I'll bet there are still people that believe in the Grey.
Well, I'll let the future me handle that problem. Meanwhile, I'll go ahead and break down the video.
To deconstruct this foolishness you first need to establish
which fake thing you believe in: is the alien
inside the building glowing like a nightlight while everything else is dark?
Or, is it a reflection of the Alien (which would put him with the press corps)?
I'm going to go with the latter. Except instead of an alien
I'm going to attribute the reflection to one of these guys shirts
The glass in those whitehouse French doors is slightly warped which distorts reflections creating weird forms.
Through the long lens of the broadcast camera you're seeing a cameraman's shoulder lit by the sun.
And this? Don't kid yourself.
You know it's a person passing by. But why does it look like such a specific alien? And for that matter,
why are these similar looking ""Greys"" found consistently in different images around the world?
Well, once again, your mind is the culprit.
It doesn't just look for patterns-- it looks for a specific type of pattern: the face.
And when looking for a face where there is none, it tries hard to imagine one,
averaging together the multitude of shapes and colors of faces it knows into the
unimaginative grey little creature you so love to fear.
So what about the video's key question? Would you believe it?
Recently, the poster of the video suddenly annotated an update
dismissing the whole thing.
Aw man, the Illuminati must have gotten to him.
Sometimes I long for a day when I get to meet a real alien.
Get to shake its hand and examine its genetic profile.
I long for a day when I, alongside a thousand other people, can see a genuine
intergalactic spaceship make a low pass across the sky.
I long for a day when a single
supernatural occurrence, or,
shadowy conspiracy theory is proven to be true. I welcome it.
It just hasn't happened yet.
*suspenseful sound effect*
If it does, be sure to give me a call.
I'm off to enjoy the world-- for what it is. Remember: love with your heart, use your head for everything else.
Captain
Disillusion!"
"
Gree-- *loud bang* Cut. Alright, let's reset...No, you know what, just keep rolling, keep rolling, keep rolling. We'll fix it in post.
Hi kids, Captain Disillusion here. You know, as much as I love the movie business,
there's no business more superstitious and slow to change.
For the longest time, filmmaker Steven Spielberg refused to put his movies out on DVD because he didn't believe the DVD format would catch on.
And of course, the various urban legends surrounding the deaths of famous actors are always rampant.
But then there are the pointless, utterly ridiculous myths for which Captain Disillusion is forced to compromise his integrity,
bend copyright laws, and show (for educational purposes and within the bounds of the fair use clause) a clip from
the 1987 comedy ""3 Men and a Baby.""
*click*
Woman: ""Oh, she's so lovely...""
Captain Disillusion (voiceover): It's an urban legend you may have heard of.
About halfway through the film, when Ted Danson's character's mother comes to see the baby and carries it across the room,
*spooky music*
an ominous figure of a young boy can be seen standing in the window
The story is, of course, that a family that lived in the apartment previously had a young son who committed suicide,
and that the figure is his ghostly apparition.
It has even been claimed that, after this paranormal discovery, VHS
re-releases of the film had the scene cut out, out of respect for the grieving family.
There are only two problems with that story.
One, the interiors of the film are not shot in a grieving family's apartment, but in a soundstage in Toronto, Canada.
And two, as far as we know, there's no such thing as ghosts.
*glass shatters*
*upbeat music*
Yes indeed, as already well explained by other sources, the figure is nothing more than a life-sized cutout of Danson's
character Jack wearing a tuxedo and a top hat. The sequence explaining the origins of the cutout was
""cut out"" of the film, but for comparison, the cutout itself can be clearly seen in a later ""scene.""
It may be poor set decoration, but there's nothing supernatural about it.
The slightly smaller size of the cutout and the way the curtains partially disguise it
do make the figure look like a small boy, an illusion enhanced by the all-forgiving blurriness of VHS video.
The good news is that, as home video formats and web video sharing sites continue to improve in quality,
we can look forward to fewer intentional and unintentional paranormal hoax videos.
Oh, and uh, as for the claim that the scene with the anomaly was officially removed from the ""3 Men and a Baby"" video release,
well, it appears. That's not true either.
Come on.
A major Hollywood distribution company's not going to go into the trouble of intricately altering a feature film over some creepy anomaly.
They only do that to avoid sculpture copyright disputes,
or to posthumously censor a master director's work in order to avoid an NC-17 rating and achieve a higher theatrical gross.
Anyway, just remember: Beneath the glamour and mystique of even the most high-profile productions, it's just a bunch of guys filming another guy who's...
Dammit! Just...just keep rolling.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go, kids.
A couple of crew members on a web series set are about to get reprimanded for incompetence.
Remember, love with your heart, use your head for everything else.
Captain Disillus... ion...
Hey, where'd everybody go? Come on guys, come back!
Seriously."
"
Greetings, children! Captain D here. It seems that a great many of you are from England
Konnichiwa! Were you aware that aside from introducing the world to bowler hats,
Monty Python, and the art of acting gay without actually being gay
the innovators in some of England's film and television
post-production facilities in the 80s have been largely responsible for bringing the visual effects industry into the digital realm
It's true. You guys are all right.
Which makes what I'm about to say all the more difficult.
I submit to you that not everything to come out of England is actually good
Order! Order!
I draw your attention to Exhibit 'A.'
It was the London Evening Standard that first broke the story about the mysterious NASA photograph showing
what looks like a person on the surface of Mars
and of course, it wasn't too long before CNN America picked up the scent: Exhibit 'B.'
Male CNN Anchor: Hey this one comes from NASA - take a look at it
It's the Mars explorer; Spirit sent back this image from Mars four years ago...
Female Anchor: Whoa!
Male Anchor: I know! The photo's creating a lot of excitement particularly on the internet. Is that a man on Mars, a guy walking a stroller?
Captain D: No, you f-!
I'm sorry.
We should keep an open mind, and examine the evidence, right? After all, this does look significantly
anthropomorphic, and did you know that around the time of this image the Mars explorer Spirit stopped transmitting data?
(Shortly before it started up again, and everything was fine...)
Hey kids, today's daily word of the day is parei-ee...
...para... datasearching! (heh!),
the brain's tendency to find meaningful patterns in vague and random stimuli
Look, there's another one! And there, and that guy tripped. We're doomed!
What, that doesn't do anything for you? Well, that's because this doesn't look like just any guy strolling along Mars,
it looks like this particular image of this particular guy in this
particular monkey suit. The mind doesn't take anything at face value.
You see an image and the mind immediately compares it to something similar you've seen before and an assumption is made... but maybe,
that assumption is completely wrong.
And when life gets confusing, it's best to zoom out
This is the full panoramic image assembled from the rover's transmission
These rocks are adjacent to the ones on which the rover's standing.
These rocks are only a few feet away.
And the mystery object is only a few inches tall, but to be fair, so is the only known Martian.
Aside from that, the part of the image that features the anomaly is taken at a downward angle
which would place the Martian walking at a strange
45-degree tilt and everybody knows that only earthlings do that.
Final conclusion? The picture is of a weird rock.
And unless you live in a gas giant, that's definitely not newsworthy.
I don't know what kind of operation you're running out there Evening Standard, but my advice is
stick to factual stories and Bob's your uncle.
And now for something completely different."

[Intro drumroll]
CD:  Greetings, Children, Captain Disillusion here.
You know...
I'm not going to be around forever.
Your great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great grandchildren...
...just might find themselves without a hero...
...a role model...
...a guide to sanity...
...a dashing cape-less crusader...
...so you've got to arm yourself... now!
With the knowledge that will prevent you and yours
from gawking at videos...
...LIKE THIS!
*High-intensity video of a KC-135 military craft plays*
Now, planes are always cool...
...stunts are frequently impressive...
...and stupidity is occasionally entertaining...
...but none of that is present in this video,
because this video is not real.
*Glass breaking*
So, how do we consistently spot
the tell-tale signs of an illusion?
Well...
...it's an art form.
*Begin video breakdown*
And, like in almost any art...
...you work from the rough and general,
to the detailed and specific.
Take a look at the scene as a whole:
Is there anything off about it?
Could a giant KC-135 Air Force refueling plane
fly this low, at this speed, with its landing gear up?
Considering that the scene is captured up close...
...this four-engine plane
produces surprisingly little sound.
The hollers of the soldiers are clearly heard.
Now here's audio of a real low passing plane...
...with only TWO ENGINES,
GOING AT MUCH SLOWER SPEED!
Damn...
Switching to detail,
study individual elements of the shot...
...without considering the context.
The plane's shadow changes position quite a bit,
for a midday sunlit scene...
The tree at the end is an awfully convenient place to be rid of an artificial shadow as the plane gets farther...
But after all these considerations, 
remember to question your own conclusions:
Other individuals can be seen 
capturing the event with their cameras...
Can these alternate angles
be found anywhere on the internet?
Consider the possibility that the original shot
actually showed a different...
...more capable aircraft doing the stunt...
...and that the large KC-135
was superimposed on top of it.
Consider the possibility
that the low resolution web video...
...is simply not detailed enough
to draw a solid conclusion.
*Glass breaks and record scratches*
Crowd:  What?!
CD:  That's right. I said it!  In an uncertain case like this...
...there's always a possibility that the shot is real.
Don't fall into the habit of acting like a know-it-all
when you simply don't have all the facts.
Bottom line is:
Always ask questions because,
by itself, a fake video is not a big deal.
But it becomes a piece of trash...
...on the otherwise pristine avenues of your mind.
And it's compounded by more trash
in the form of countless other hoaxes...
...bombarding you every single day...
Until you no longer see the world for what it is,
but rather someone's abstract...
...biased, superstitious idea of the world...
...and that's only fun for a while.
So...
How about a little spring cleaning?
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go, kids...
Another tourist in Las Vegas is about to get whiplash from the light show!  Every other day it's Vegas!
Remember, love with your heart,
use your head for everything else...
Captain Disillusion!

Greetings children Captain D here! I would like to introduce you to a friend of mine
He lives right here in the lamp and his name is Mr. Flare.
[Mr. Flare] Hey Captain how you doing good to see you! [Capt. D] You too, Mr. Flare.
[Mr. Flare] Oh hello, Children
[Capt. D] Um so Mr. Flare sounds like a very glamorous name, but you're actually a pretty down-to-earth sort of guy, isn't that true?
[Mr. Flare] That's right CD. I'm simple and easy to get along with but you know what that doesn't mean
I'm worthless and don't deserve recognition and respect [Capt. D] and and you you really like to travel right?
[Mr. Flare] I sure do. I've been all over the world and present at some of the most important events in history:
the 2006 night launch of the space shuttle Discovery, the launch of any space thing really, the police reunion tour
the reenactment of the World Trade Center reenactment of the Iwo, Jima
Raising of the flag by the Lafayette high school cheerleading squad. Hell, I met most of these kids watching
Although you wouldn't know it from the way they act. [Capt. D] all right now. [Mr. Flare] I'm not finished
They don't want to give me my due credits. They'd rather believe I'm some
Paranormal orb or ghost or angel! Well angel my big refracted a--
[Capt. D] Okay, thank you, Mr. Flare
He raises a good point, though.
A camera lens is an imperfect device. Light can bounce around its various elements and create weird anomalies on the image
Some people choose to regard this as evidence of paranormal occurrences. My question is why?
Here's a perfect example
This video claims to show some sort of fire angel
Hovering around a bonfire at a gathering of chanting Christians in Honduras
But you'd have to be completely dense not to realize that this is nothing more than a lens flare from the fire itself
Aside from the fact that it moves in concert with the camera if you look carefully you can see that
It's an actual miniature image of the fire upside down
So why do some people continue to post ordinary videos like this and then fill the descriptions with ridiculous lies?
My guess is for attention
But you don't need to make stuff up to get some personal attention
Just leave the computer once in a while and go hang out with a friend
Better yet, make new ones like Mr. Flare.
[Mr. Flare] ass! Wow, sorry. I just had to get that out of my system
[Capt. D] But now I'm afraid it's time for us to go kids
[Mr. Flare] Yeah. An undergrad in California is about to take a picture of his family against a shiny metal wall
[Capt. D] Remember love with your heart use your head for everything else [Flare] And don't be such a freakin idiot!
Captain Disillusion
Mr. Flare!"

Greetings, children
Captain Disillusion here and tonight, We're going to have fun
I won't give you my usual lecture on the morality of creating and believing fake imagery, because I want to make it clear
Special effects are, above all, a source of entertainment, and when they're used for entertainment purposes, I love them
Enjoying cinematic puzzles, and then trying to figure out how they were created is good for the brain, so tonight
Let's take a look at a well known video by a group of inventive kids calling themselves ""Never Hide Films""
You've probably seen it. It features two funny guys and one of them is able to catch sunglasses right on his head, in like
Totally radical ways
Of course, many smart kids posted partial theories on how the tricks were done
But there's never been a definitive explanation because there's no singular answer, it was a combination of techniques
So, since the video has been around a long time, and I'm sure the creators won't mind, let's break it down
Captain Disillusion style
Alright there are seven scenes with effects in the video. The intro is a combination of two
seamlessly combined shots. The first displayed back in reverse, and the glasses are not thrown at the catcher,
but pulled toward the thrower's hand by an incredible invention, the string!
So it's all played back in reverse until the swish pan, during which there is an invisible cut to a
straightforward shot where the characters leave.
In the Roof scene, it's the opposite. The first half is straightforward,
then, there's a seamless cut, see?
upside down, right side up, upside down, right side up.
and the second half is performed in reverse with the glasses once again pulled off the catcher by the trusty string
The overpass scene has done exactly the same way.
The elevator is a single reverse shot with the glasses pulled by the string as soon as the doors open.
Now, the skateboard catapult shot is a very fancy transition between two shots as the glasses are launched
They seem to have been isolated and guided to fly toward the catcher's face,
whose side was filmed separately and actually he's wearing the glasses the whole time but for the brief moment that he's on screen before the
fake glasses reach him, a frame of his face without glasses is
superimposed over his actual face. The glasses from the other shot and the fake face
disappear on the frame where the catching is supposed to occur. Nice and clean.
The skateboarding is a simple reverse shot using the string, and they left you a clue listen to the sound of the wheels on the pavement
It's backwards!
That sounds right. Hey impressive backwards skateboarding skills
Now I want to see the outtakes. Now even though the guy's movements are a little weird in the beginning of the car scene
No, reverse playback was used.
This is a fancy version of a split screen effect look at the car dimensions here.
The post, and everything after it is a after it is a
Separately filmed portion. The gag is that the thrower doesn't actually throw the glasses at all, and for a few frames a face with glasses
Is once again pasted and tracked on top of the catcher's face.
Until the split reveals a shot where the glasses really are on him. The close-up insert was done
separately using the same reverse motion and string technique, and was filmed with the car moving a little slower.
We may be able to break it down,
But that doesn't mean it didn't take a lot of work. Never Hide Films probably had to tape
Straightforward versions of some shots in order to reverse them and learn the backwards choreography.
And if you think you know everything, check out their sequel to this called ""Bobbing for Glasses."" That one's a lot tougher to figure out.
But now, I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids.
A teen in Washington is confused and upset by the visual trickery in an old Bewitched episode this might require some visual aids.

Greetings children, gather round Captain Disillusion and I'll tell you a story.
The Epic tale of Bare Wolf. I
Mean barzolff, barzolff 814
He journeyed from France to the cursed Land of Crappy online UFO Videos and
Single-Handedly Raised The Bar on Realism.
Admit it the first time you
Saw the Famed Haiti Ufo Video
The Unexpected Visual Combined With the sound of the woman Gasping from off-Screen sent a genuine chill down your spine.
[Woman Gasping]
It's an impressive Piece of Work in and of Itself, but what's most remarkable about it is how quickly and
Categorically its appearance separated The Skeptics From the Believers.
To the skeptics this, was just too good to be true right away, they
Noticed little things like identical palm trees and the existence of another video containing what looks like
Preliminary tests of the animation Barzolff expertly used lighting with radiosity
and a combination of keyframe and procedural animation techniques to Imitate natural handheld camcorder
Behavior and create a stunningly realistic but completely computer-generated
shot. And the skeptics all settled on the fact that it was a really cool
Video. A cool, fake video.
But to the believers it was something different, it was a vine at which to grasp to keep their imaginary world of
unseen forces alive.
On websites with articles detailing how the effect
Was done they commented with opinions about minute details that might prove the video to be real.
They were debunking it in reverse. And even Though Barzolff explained his work through an Interview in an LA Times Article and
Cnn headline News Aired a piece About the LA Times Article, and even Though the mighty
Sword With Which Barzolff  accomplished this feat
Otherwise known as View Six Infinite by ion Software was cited [by] Many
Animators and the infamous palm tree clone model Can be easily found and examined inside the program,
Still they wanted to believe.
So Barzolff created something new.
He posted a video of two ladies playing with a remote-controlled, toy version of the Haiti Spaceship in effect
Debunking his Own Video. And the reactions poured in. The Believers
Protested with comments like
""There's A great deal of
Difference between the two craft in the footage. The two Ufo Haiti craft could not look more real because they are real"" and
""Oh my god why this guy's trying to convince other people that Ufos are Fake"".
While The Vindicated Skeptics Proclaimed that's the Ufo towing Ufo Haiti
""I don't know how this guy got six million views on a fake video but it pisses me off"" and ""Ha Ha Ha!
I had one of those!""
But what They Didn't know
Was that this video was fake too, this was another illusion!
There aren't levitating toys like this it was a slightly altered version of the ship model
Animated, 3D motion tracked, and composited Into Live-Action footage.
Some people did figure this out but that wouldn't make my story very interesting.
Barzolff tricked everyone, without ever making false claims or revealing his identity.
Until Tonight, for you see
I am Barzolff.
No I'm just kidding with you Kids. That would have been cool! A hero can dream though.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids!
There's a voice calling me, it's saying something over and over but I can't understand very much
Yes i can hear you. Yes, I'm Coming!
Remember Navigator, love with your heart, but use your head for everything else!

Greetings, children!
You better keep your distance tonight ,because Captain Disillusion is angry!
[softens tone]Alright, come on.
I'm not really angry, come back. I'm more...disappointed.
Disappointed in you, that's right.
Don't cry.
Sometimes it doesn't seem to take any effort for someone to make you believe a hoax is real.
No special effects. No testimony. No shaky cameras.
Just...context.
In this video, a person left a camera on overnight to find out what his dog has been whining at.
And discovered in the footage that the blinds on the back door open, close, and rise mysteriously by themselves.
The video is nearly four minutes long, but you get the idea.
I have just one question, kids.
And this is important for me to know for safety purposes.
How many of you are idiots?
Because judging from the response to that video, it's a lot
Hundreds of thousands of views.
Thousands of comments, and not just any comments.
Flair: ""Man, your video gave me chills!""
""This is some really freaky stuff, dude. At 1:36, you can see your dog's hind legs being pushed.""
""I'd be deathly afraid of whatever it may be.""
""Dude, pack your damn bags, that was weird!""
""Dogs and animals are smarter than us, and the dog saw and the video proves it, so I think that you need to leave before it gets bad.""
""Try to capture some EVP, pay attention to the times it occurs, see if there's a pattern.""
""Also, look above the dog's head, something rises before the dog gets hit. Anyway, get out of there, it's a poltergeist demon.""
""I know because I used to live with one. Get a priest to help or a 'Wicken'""
""At 2:33, the dog gets hit by something, you can hear it and you can see it get hit on the shoulder.""
""Now if that's real, that means everything else is real too.""
As a crusader of digital truth, my life is different.
But if I was more like you -- if I had a pet dog and a house, and I got brand new
electrically-powered blinds for the back door of that house,
I bet my dog would find them strange and amusing, too.
There's literally nothing to explain on this one, kids. Do you really need me to do a breakdown?
Fine!
The video is preceded by a long, colorful and biased description, the definitive calling card of a hoax
Its real purpose is to get the impressionable viewers' mind in the mood to be screwed with.
At the start of this supposedly unmanned overnight surveillance shoot, the dog isn't heard approaching before it enters the shot.
It simply shuffles right in, which indicates it was positioned just out of frame.
The demeanor of the dog is friendly, curious, and playful.
It wags its tail, squeals excitedly, and after the blinds reveal the exterior the dog's attention seems to be focused on going outside.
It also distinctly glances at the camera several times.  I wonder why?
And it doesn't get hit by anything.
It jumps at the loud clicking noise that seems to be made by the blinds as they stop, [Loud Click]
an involuntary reaction found in every other living thing.
And there's nothing extraordinary about shifting blinds,
whether they're controlled electrically or mechanically by their usual strings which are not seen in the shot.
Oh, and that's not a face of a demon. It's just you being a gullible doofus.
Context fooled you, so let context set you straight.
Look at the video creator's YouTube profile.
His other videos are magic trick demonstrations and more hokey humorous ghost premises.
He wasn't even being serious, you were just being gullible.
Don't disrespect your own intelligence.
I still believe in you.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go, kids!
A student in Kansas is scared...for religious reasons.
This could be another long one.
Remember: love with your heart, use your head for everything else!

Greetings, children!  Captain D here.
Tonight, I'd like to talk to you about
how creepy you all are.
Ever since humanity invented and then convinced
itself of the existence of phantom and spirits,
the whole world - and its hot, easy sister, the Internet -
have been inundated with grainy photos and videos
of would-be ghosts.
And for some reason the scariest of these are always appearing as either scraggy wrinkly old people,
or creepy little children.
Such is the case with this Youtube favorite
floating around on.
[speaking Japanese]
CD: [faux spooky noises]
[clears throat]
Kids, I know that there are times when not believing something you see feels really, really wrong.
But don't worry.
That's just your brain adjusting
to the nice cold bubble bath of healthy disillusion.
Hey, it's better than staying
in the hot muggy gazebo of gullibility.
Just relax, let the bubbles do their work.
Let's break this one down.
Your first clue that it's fake should be the fact
that it's from a Japanese entertainment show.
And we all know how factual Japanese TV is:
[Clips of Japanese game shows]
CD:  And think about what exactly happens here.
The girl glances at herself and her reflection
remains still as she turns back around.
But then what happened?
Why did the mother taping the video stop shooting?
And if she didn't, why weren't we shown the rest of it?
Did the ghost ever turn away?
Isn't it much more likely that the creator of the video simply froze the footage of the girl's reflection...
...isolating it from the rest of the image
 with a simple matte?
Notice how this shaky handheld shot...
...becomes perfectly stable
just before the apparition appears.
It's our old friend, Mr. Motion-tracking.
If you look carefully you can even see
a slight wiggle and misalignment...
...between the ghost and the edge of the mirror
at the very end of the shot.
This is because the hoaxer didn't bother
stabilizing the camera's rotational movement.
As fakes go, this isn't even a very imaginative one.
But it does take a special imagination...
...to look at a home video of your daughter's cute antics in front of the makeup mirror...
...and then decide to doctor it up
in a creepy and disturbing way...
...and then sell it to be shown on National TV.
Oh well.
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids!
A baby in Tacoma is about to develop 
a serious fear of abandonment issues...
...from a too well-executed game of Peekaboo!
But not if I can help it!
Love with your heart, use your head for everything else!

Greetings children
it's me, Captain Disillusion
You know
looking at the world in an objective and empirical way
is key to a healthy and well balanced life.
Don't get me wrong
Dreaming, wishing and hoping
are basic and vital to human nature.
and suspension of disbelief is super fun.
But only as long as you can clearly tell the difference between belief
and reality.
Reality is real.
Your beliefs are in your head.
If you spend any amount of time on the internet
you've probably come across this hilarious little video
of a penguin bitch-slapping another penguin.
Ah, penguins. Is there anything they can't do?
Well actually there is... this exact thing you just saw.
Boys and girls, when you watch that...
you do realize that the video is fake, right?
I ask because the footage
is posted dozens of times over on
YouTube and on many other sites people
use it as a profile picture and yet I
have never, not once seen a single
comment proposed that the video might be
an artificial special effect.
That worries me, so I'm gonna break it down for you.
The video is actually of one
penguin walking across a thin patch of
ice and falling through it.
The other penguin is artificially inserted into
the scene with compositing.
You can easily tell he's fake if you look at the
shadows of the two penguins as they intersect.
One is darker than the other.
In reality they would merge into a single solid shape.
A technique called motion tracking can make it look like
the fake penguin is standing in a
specific spot even as the camera's moving.
As a last step, an animation of a
slapping wing is created and the whole
thing is rotoscoped or traced to appear
behind the falling penguin.
You know something children?
I thought that the original video of one penguin
falling through the ice was pretty funny on its own
But I guess someone very
clever thought that they could knock it
up a notch, which usually means adding an
element of humiliation or hostile behavior.
Oh well.
But now I must go kids,
there's a girl in Wisconsin who's
considering writing a letter to Santa Claus.
This could take a while.
Remember, love with your heart
but use your head for everything else
(Voice) Captain Disillusion!"
"
I saw this video on Twitter with over five million views and then again on YouTube with nearly 1 million views
Basically, this guy modified his cellphone case with propellers to take selfies
Which is awesome my only issue with it is that it's not only fake, but it's a scam which I'll explain in a minute
but as for being fake
The first clue is that these are three volts seven millimeter micro brush motors like you see here if you attach one to a beam
Like this and turn it on at full throttle you'll see the most weight that it can lift is six quarters or about thirty grams.
The cell phone in the video with all the flying gear attached would weigh about 300 grams
and since drones are typically designed to hover at 70% max thrust you would need at least
15 of these motors to do what he did, but you know, this just doesn't look as catchy
In fact, we recreated the exact setup
he used in the video and turn the motors to full throttle and this is what happened here.
Here it is in slow mo and as you can see there's hardly any difference than if you don't turn the propellers on at all
so I'm gonna show you how this scam artist somehow manages to break the laws of physics four more times in this three-minute video and
then because obeying laws of physics isn't optional
we're gonna call a fellow youtuber Captain Disillusion to see if he can help us spot any signs of a special effects. And then
with my buddy Peter Sripol i'm going to show you what it would take to
Actually build a flying selfie phone case and then i'll put all the details on a new set. I built using wix.com.
But, before I do any of that
let me first explain why this is a scam and not just a harmless fake video for meaningless internet points.  With this many views and
An astounding 80% like ratio, which means most people probably didn't realize it was fake
It's a statistical certainty that some young aspiring engineer
actually tried to build this themselves
worse than their parents phone dropping like a rock and breaking
this might have been his or her first experience at making something.  But, how you might ask would they know what components to use well?
here in the description amazing maker was kind enough to put links Amazon affiliate links
you can tell by the URLs.
So he is making money off the crushed dreams of aspiring engineers without enough experience yet to this is total BS and aspiring engineers
are my people, and you don't mess with my people.
Let's do this
the second gratuitous violation of physics comes in this scene the force of gravity always points down but helicopter spinning blades create a force perpendicular
to the blades themselves
so if you want to hover you need to be level so the forces will cancel out and you won't move if you tilt forward
and then break the thrust force into its x and y components
you suddenly have an unbalanced force that will move you in that direction in essence
that's how helicopters move forward by tipping forward in other words
It's physically impossible to hover in an orientation like this
The forward thrust component is unbalanced and it would have to move the phone forward
The third major issue is the Arduino compatible circuit board
he chose.  It's the same board here and it's supposed to be the brains for the drone
yet, this specific model of board doesn't come with any sort of gyroscope or accelerometer.
Here's why that matters if you've ever tried,
balancing something on your hand like this you and your body we're creating what's referred to as a closed-loop feedback control system.
So if it starts to tip over my eyes relay that to my brain and my hand says hey
I'm no longer fuelling the weight just up and down
it's also pushing my hand this way and so my brain takes all that information and
responds by telling my hand to move this way at a specific speed in order to compensate.
So, to keep this thing balanced there's this continuous loop of quickly gathering information and then making real-time adjustments and closed feedback
loops are used all over in engineering from the simple case of a thermostat that
continuously checks the air and turns on at a certain temperature to
dart boards that update their position 200 times a second to get a bull's-eye every time
to machines that are abused and most certainly for anything that flies and needs to stay in the air the fact that his board is
missing a gyroscope and an accelerometer
means there's no way for it to tell if it's starting to rotate or to fall in any direction
It's the equivalent of trying to balance the board wearing a blindfold and an oven mitt
you have no idea what adjustments to make to keep things balanced.  Which is the perfect lead-in to the fourth major physics
Flaw notice how he attaches these motors and rigidly fixes them to the phone double-stick tape
this means if you start to tip forward
you have no way to self-correct the phone
orientation and it would just turn into a nosedive, if you only have two propellers in this configuration
they both need to be able to rotate with respect to the phone in order to correct the movements in all six degrees of freedom
for example if it starts to tip forward
you could rotate them both back like this
to correct for that.  Or if the wind is trying to spin the phone this way they could assume this configuration to
counter that to return to our balancing shovel analogy by fixing the motors directly to the case
you lose your ability to even make corrections
so not only do you have no idea where to move, but your arm is locked out for making adjustments anyways
which makes it literally impossible to balance.
Owwww.
My final physics issue with this video is one of acoustics
this guy proposes using it as a hands-free way to watch your favorite super hip music videos
conveniently dubbing over the audio here
for reference this is what an episode of the office would sound like on a phone at full volume
and don't forget that you would actually need 13 more motors than this so it would be at least six times louder.  [Extremely Loud Whirling Sound]
So now that we thoroughly established a multitude of physical laws have been broken.
Let's find out exactly how he faked it and to do that
I've arranged video call with the undisputed heavyweight champion of the bunking fake videos using special effects Captain disillusion
Be sure to get it as flush as possible against your skin to minimize folds that might make it hard to
chroma key out like this
nice and tight
Captain oh hi Mart Mart robber you weren't supposed to call yet. It's 2 o'clock
I'm actually even 5 minutes late, really.
Well then.
How can I help you
did you not even watch the video I sent
ah, yes, of course the mobile drone video
I've analysed that thoroughly mark and my conclusion is it's totally real
Seriously, yes
Everything except for the mobile drone part, that's fake
if you look very
closely
You might just be able to make out the huge
chattering mask on the side of the phone
Visible in every shot of it flying the creator must have been in a real hurry because it's so messy here
it cuts off the edge of the phone here the tip of his finger and here it reveals the thing
it's supposed to be hiding a rod. It's narrow and light-colored and probably attached with the same mounting tape
He used to tack on all the other gadgets
That's why he's able to grab and adjust the phone in this shot by the river the mask hides not just the stick
But the whole person holding it look closer on this site the real-time
Water and on this side a still frame from an empty version of the shot
And if we track the phone's position and rotation we can easily
Reverse-engineer exactly how the stick puppeteer did rotating mostly from the point where it was held
Wow
That was very impressive captain D
Thank you for taking the time favorite part of this whole thing is the audio
The tiny propellers must have made so little noise at a distance. It didn't give a proper drone vibe
So the hoaxers recorded the sound of the motors up close and reused the same clip in every scene
complete with their muttering voices in the background
[Whirling Noise and Muffled Voices]
Awesome well, thanks again.
But, even though impressive is the number of posts messages and tweets
Presumably from people with functioning eyeballs asking me if this painfully obvious edit is real over and over.
Okay, captain will take care. I've got to go back to my even you mark how could you do this to me?
How could you do?
He's such a joker. So let's fake and now you know
exactly all the reasons why but still a really interesting idea and I was curious what it would look like if you actually
built one of these at using less special effects and more practical engineering.
So, naturally I called in my buddy Peter Shree people whose qualifications
Include building his own electric flame from scratch and he immediately got to work.
Turns out if you take two brushless motors to electronic motor speed controllers a flight controller that actually has a gyroscope and an accelerometer
Integrated a 3d printed frame and two servos to articulate the rotors a radio
transmitter for remote control and a force the lipo battery and then you put them all together it actually works.
Kind of we had to do a bunch of test flights to calibrate that
Feedback control loop we talked about before
so if we notice the drone is either under
compensating or over compensating when it starts to fall in a certain way
we tweak the response
sensitivity in between flights until we get to the sweet spot and I should mention remember how the motors from the fake video could barely
Lift only six quarters. Well, if you properly sized them for the task at hand, they should be able to lift 150 quarters.
And so once we felt like we had it in pretty good shape. We took her out for the maiden test flight
[Music Plays]
They in our defense it was a little windy out there
but as you can see, it can be pretty wobbly at times the truth is a bike copter like this totally works
it just isn't a great design choice.
The reason pretty much all camera drones are quad copters is because they're much more stable due to a larger footprint shared between four motors
and by getting clever with the throttle speeds you can move in all six degrees of freedom with no moving parts
So there you go with solid engineering. You don't need hidden rods or masking and rotoscoping and Sir Isaac Newton can once again
comfortably rest in his grave. So, the moral of the story is just don't cheat and lie in scam
I actually considered going a little easier on Amazing Maker
but then I happen to scan some of his other videos like this knee brace that
Charges your phone and even powers this flashlight as you walk in theory
I'll skip the details
but in reality this system would also never work as shown which is why if you whine that and stabilize on his hand in the
pocket you see him click a hidden flash light switch.
[Boom]
If you want to build a flying selfie foam case yourself
you can watch the video Peter made with all the juicy details. You can find that on his channel or new website
I created called mark rover build instructions.com, and on that site and
you'll actually see build instructions for tons of different projects from my channel, which was made possible by the fine folks at wix.com
I wanted something simple and classy and I almost feel a little guilty
I can make something dysfunctional and it only took about an hour in part. Thanks to a series of questions
you answer when you get started
that means right off the bat
you're close to what you want,
but you can still customize it as much as you like from there
including lining it with one of the hundreds of templates they have and my website is just a simple way to communicate information
but you can make one for your personal brand or your
portfolio, or maybe a new website for your business to sell stuff, or even book appointments right there.  And it's free to sign up to
start designing and publishing and it's honestly a lot of fun.

I bet there's cash
This is it escape room
It's basically where you and some friends are placed in a room and you have to solve a series of puzzles and locks to get
out in exactly one hour
and today I'm gonna give you ten proven tips to dominate any type of escape room and I say proven because me and six of
My buddies utilize these tips and even though about half of us
I've never even done an escape room before we shattered the long-standing record for this room by finishing in 38 minutes with no clues
Next we tried an even harder room to prove that it wasn't just luck and there again we finished in 46 minutes
And so the evidence seemed compelling but for further proof
I had my niece and nephew and a bunch of their friends first try a room without me telling them the tips
They only made it about halfway through at the end of the full hour
Then we walked through the ten tips together and then they went back to a new room with an equal level of difficulty and this
Time that they finished in 55 minutes with no clues now
you're probably thinking what qualifies me to be giving tips about escape rooms when I've only ever done three myself and the answer is
Absolutely, nothing. They're actually not my tips. I tracked down the architect and designer of the red bull escaping the wind championships
He's a college professor. His name is Scott Nicholson
The problem is I live here in California and he's way over here in Brantford, Ontario in Canada
And while that's typically a 12-hour trip through the magic of YouTube
I knew I could make it there in just a six second travel montage
Okay, so I am here now in Canada at the begin lab at Laurier University
With Scott Nicholson Scott. What the heck do you do? What is this place?
Well, this place is where I met games. Our focus here is actually making games to change the world
So a lot of the games we make here of some sort of learning outcome
Our goal is to help get people to learn stuff in a playful way
So professor Nicholson and I hung out together for a day as he generously spilled out the information
in his very large brain
He even put me through a few challenges and puzzles of my own and so here are the ten tips
I came away with after hanging out with him
the first step is to think simple think
Generally keep reminding yourself that the average person should be able to complete this room in one hour in a well-designed room
You won't need any extra knowledge besides what you can just find in the room people tend to overanalyze and just go down a rabbit
So for example in one room
We found the travel log of a robber and he went from Washington down to Mexico City up to Toronto
at first we were trying to look at the
interstates
He would travel on and maybe that was a code and then we're like maybe we should
Unscramble the names of the countries and then we realized his path
forms a V
which happened to be the first letter in a combination lock we were trying to open if you can't find a simple answer to a
Puzzle chances are it's because all the necessary information hasn't been revealed to you yet. So move on and then come back to it
Later, the second tip deals with searching
The first thing you should do in your to room is for everyone to split up and to start looking for clues and items
Professor Nicholson actually put me through my own searching boot camp to point out the typical places that things are hidden
There you go. Always look under tables always look under rugs
they write codes on the back of rugs other spots might be in hollowed-out books or in pockets of clothing or
Behind a door in the room a super common first-time mistake is to look in places
You should for example, you won't find a clue by disassembling a ceiling light or a power outlet
Another common searching mistake is to see Clues and things that aren't for example
The bottom of this chair has letters and numbers from the factory
But they're obviously not part of the room design because they don't fit with the theme
Going back to tip 1 the clues and key items should be fairly obvious in a well
Signed room and the more scape rooms you do the more you'll get a sense for what is and isn't a real clue tip 3
Organize your stuff as you search the room put all the clues and items in one location
So if you found three similar cups like this with numbers on the bottom group them together as you do this the bigger picture begins
To emerge and it's easier to tell what you're missing
don't let people just walk around with an item randomly in their hand that others don't know about you can ask before you start but
Almost all rooms have a policy where you use one clue or one lock only one time
so once you've used a clue or item put it in a discard pile and be sure to leave any key in the lock that
It opened this helps avoid unnecessary wasting of time when a team member is working on a puzzle
They don't realize has already been solved and used for tip four
Now that your team is starting to make sense of the room
laser
focus on what is stopping you from moving forward you are going to feel overwhelmed at the beginning even with our record breaking times about
Halfway through I thought there is no way we're gonna even come close to finishing
But then you solve one thing and then everything else starts falling into place to help with this work
Backwards from the thing that is stopping you identify that inputs it needs for example in this room
You see there is a lock here
And it looks like the key is right here, but you need some kind of hanger to fish it out now
there's a cabinet on the wall that
Probably contains that hanger and it has a lock that needs three letters and two numbers today
You can focus on clues that will yield three numbers and two letters you won't be as vulnerable to red herrings
So red herring is something that's put into the room that has no bearing upon the game. It can be something simple
oh, this has got to be really important clearly or if some rooms even have red herring puzzles that
Lead to nothing as a player. It's incredibly frustrating and so we've done some studies
So most players hate red herrings because they're waste of our time
About half designers hate red herrings and will not put them in their rooms and about half are like, yeah
They're okay to have in the roof by working backwards on the immediate inputs that are needed
You'll avoid wasting time on red herring clips tip 5 is about team rolls according to dr
Nicholson poor
Communication is the number one reason why teams fail his list of eight different roles that team members can be assigned which I will link
below
But the one that semen was critical in our experience was project manager
Because it helps alleviate the issue of poor communication. The project manager shouldn't get overly involved in puzzles instead
The project manager is the person people report to and say hey
There's a four digit combination lock over there and the project manager will call that out
Okay, everyone. We're looking for four digits. Someone comes up and says hey there's there's a five letter word lock there
Okay, we're looking for five letters. There's a poster over there. That looks funny. Okay
So everyone take a look at that poster if you're searching for something you might find it in that poster
So the project manager should keep an idea of what are the active tasks what needs to be done?
who's working on what and
Keep the game flow going, but try to keep themselves out of getting buried in puzzles
So they can keep a scan of what's happening
So the first five tips focused on it general team strategies, but the last half will be about puzzle solving strategies
you should be familiar with most common locks and their inputs because again if you're working back from what's stopping you and you know a
Lock requires three letters, then everyone could just focus on finding three letters
The standard key lock is the most obvious then a combination lock where you're just looking for four numbers in a specific order or here
Where it's a combination lock of letters and numbers
But five total then your classic dial lock where you need three numbers total and you start by spinning clockwise then open it like this
Then you've got this directional lock which is a little trickier because they can have anywhere from two to thirty inputs
squeeze down here three times to wipe it clean
If you need to try again
Finally you have one of these lock boxes that are again tricky because they've got anywhere from two to ten inputs
But it's good to know. They can only use each number once and the order doesn't matter
So one six zero five works
But so does five zero six one a critical tip of locks is if you're pretty sure you have the right code
But it's not opening have someone else try before you move on just given the pressure of the game
We have this tip save us on three separate occasions
and finally
you can skip trying to figure out the last digit if you know all the rest of them just by trial and error because there
Were only be ten options according to Professor Nicholson's research about half of all escape rooms will have some kind of code that you need
To decipher. There's a few basic codes
I've seen again and again and just knowing what they look like is useful now
You're not gonna be expected to memorize the encoding scheme, but it tells you how we're looking for an encoding scheme
So in the upper left anytime, you see dots and dashes you should be thinking Morse code
Usually it's written
But sometimes it can be lights that are flashing long and short or even long and sure
Sounds the upper right is called Pigpen cipher and it's often disguised as hieroglyphics. The key will look something like this
So see if you could decode the message then anytime you see dots in a group of six like this
You know, you're looking at a Braille key each letter in Braille is some combination of six dots and finally, dr
Nicholson said in his experience
The only time you might not get to the coder key is if there are a set of numbers ranging from 1 to 26 in
That case you match them up with a corresponding letter in the alphabet. So this becomes
H-e-l-l-o
Debate is about written clues. Dr
Nicholson created this challenge for me of the four most common styles of hiding clues in written text
Pause the video and see if you can find the four separate hidden messages here
The first is the most obvious with the bold letters. Look at the watch face
The second are all the words missing a letter. So remove the telephone
Keypad find the secret next and this one stumped us for a little while in one of the rooms we did is to just look
at the capitalized words
The secret code is 6 7 3 4 and finally if you look at the first word of each new line on the left side
The secret phrase is goodnight sweet prince
Makini TVs is looking for something that stands out from the normal pattern you would expect to see which leads us to our second to
Last tip look for patterns. Dr. Nicholson gave me one last challenge here. Now the lock that you have meit's indicates
You need to enter things in the order of a red green blue. This one is pretty straightforward
But what do you think the code is here?
In fact pause the video if you want to decipher all 3 codes on the board here. The top is 4 3 6
Based on the number of sides this one at the bottom
You just need to count the different colored circles and then enter them in that order
So 3 6 4 1 and finally in the middle, you see this digital numerical notation used a lot in escape rooms
So here the code is 5 for 7 apologies to my colorblind peeps out there because you probably couldn't solve that last one
Which is exactly the type of reason why you should cycle people through trying to solve the tough puzzles a fresh perspective
Is all it takes in many cases this helped us multiple times. And for the final tip your guide is your friend
Listen closely when they're giving their instructions at the beginning a lot of times they will give subtle hints about issues that trip a lot
Of people up you can also ask some high-level questions
like if they have a 1 lock
Use policy and even if you don't want hints you can ask them to prompt you if you're way behind where most people would be
At a certain point at the end of the day you're there to have fun
so it's better to take a hint and feel the excitement of escaping the room than being stuck on a
Frustrating clue for 40 minutes and finally fewer people is almost always better statistically
You'll have a higher success rate because you don't have to deal with the issues of poor communication amongst 10 people
But there's also a finite number of fun things to do in a room
So the fewer people you have the more fun stuff that everyone gets to do to quote from dr
Nichols's twitter my policy for the number of people in an escape room is the same as the number of people in a tent
No matter what the package says, you'll have a better time at half capacity. So there you go
Now, you know all the best strategies to dominate your next escape room
All that's left is to get your brain in shape and to do that
You got to use the logic courses at brilliant org on the off chance that you've never heard of them
Brilliant is an interactive website that focuses on just teaching science courses through intuition instead of memorizing formulas
But here's the trick
passive learning doesn't work nearly as well as active learning so they teach a principle and then they follow up with engaging puzzles or an
Interactive demo, so you actually retain the information you can access brunet org from your computer or use the app
Which is super popular with 4.7 stars from over 40,000 ratings
and so no matter your current level of understanding if you want to quickly get smarter about a bunch of different science topics while

What is the scientifically proven best way to skip a rock?
This is kind of hard to figure out
because every rock you throw is a little different,
not to mention your throwing motion might accidentally vary in between throws.
So to solve that I built a perfect rock skipping robot with my nieces and nephews.
So today I'm going to show you how we used what we learned from the perfect robot
to improve their throws on average from 3 to 13 skips.
Let's get started.
This is Lake Cavanaugh, it's located here in Washington State.
I came here every summer for a few weeks as a kid growing up.
and my memory of it is just this magical place to be outdoors and to be with family,
but to also discover my independence.
And of course to find a way to compete in anything,
[laughing]
including rock skipping.
And this is my first time back in 15 years,
so to commemorate that I wanted to build something really cool.
So we took a clay pigeon thrower and tweaked the spring,
and machined an adapter plate,
and then made some custom throwing arms from wood.
Then we created a base for stability.
And now all that was left
was to challenge my nieces and nephews
to a rock skipping contest.
Only I might have neglected
to tell them about my creation.
Actually forget this
[Surprised Yells]
You guys ready?
3... 2... 1...

[Mark Cheering]
[Others Cheering]
So it actually wasn't that impressive right out of the gate.
But that was intentional,
because for this video I wanted to pull back the curtain
on some secrets about the engineering design process.
There are four steps I follow for any big project I've ever built
on this channel or in real life.
The first is research.
I will go online and look at any published papers
watch any videos on the topic
and then talk via Skype or email with any experts I could find.
That usually gives me a rough idea of where to start
and so the next step is to build a prototype.
A good prototype is cheap
and easy to reconfigure,
so you can try a lot of different things.
And then step three is to do
a sensitivity analysis with the prototype.
That means we try lots of different combinations
of settings to see what actually matters
and what doesn't.
And only at that point
are we ready to take what we've learned and move to step 4
which is building the final version.
[ting noise]
[screaming]
So often people want to jump straight to step 4
which usually won't work,
but it's almost worse if it does,
because you have no confidence
that you're close to the optimal design.
For the rock skipping robot
I'd already done steps 1 and 2
so we all sat down and
brainstormed about step 3
and all the things we could tweak
to find the right conditions for the perfect skip.
Eventually we came up with 4 different things to test,
but before we did that I was told
the robot needed to look a lot cooler.
[Music]
With the mission clearly accomplished
here are the four variables we decided to test.
The first was wrist angle of the robot.
This will change the angle of the rock relative to the water,
as you can see here.
So should it be perfectly flat?
Or really steep?
Or something in between?
Next was finding the right arm angle.
This changes the angle of the path of the rock
relative to the water.
So is this better?
Or is this better?
Or is something in between.
The last two variables had to do with the rocks,
but since every rock is going to be unique,
we needed a way to control this,
so we decided to make our own rocks
out of unfired clay.
That allowed us to make lots of samples
and to see how many more skips you would get
if you varied either the diameter or the thickness.
If you ever seen a primitive technology video
you know clay is just dirt and water.
This is great because it means it has a similar density to a rock,
and if you dry it in the Sun it's hard like a rock,
but then it only takes about 30 minutes
to totally dissolve away once you put it in the water.
Then we set up a testing plan
and for each throw we would change only one thing
and then count the number of skips.
That way if we suddenly saw a huge improvement
we'd know it'd be from the thing that we just changed.
That's where having a robot
is way better than using a human,
because it allows you to independently change one thing at a time.
And so as you can imagine we had a lot of skips that look like this...
or this...
or this [Scream]
But then we started to narrow in on some key parameters
and then they started to look...
more like this.
[Cheering]
[More Cheering]
[Music]
[Spring Clicks]
[More Music]
And I'm not exactly sure you count all those little skips the end,
but depending on that I would think we got some throws well into the 60's.
[Music]
And so in the end
we discovered there are four steps
to achieving the perfect rock skip.
The first is that you want the angle of your rock
relative to the water
to be about twenty degrees.
This is the optimal angle to allow the rock
to sort of crash into the water and then to make a ramp
and then use its forward momentum to ride up that ramp
and shoot back up out of the water.
And that's the exact physics that explains why rocks skip.
Next you want the path of your rock relative to the water surface
to be about twenty degrees.
This means you sort of need to start to throw high
which gives you some potential energy
to put into the system.
In the same way a ball bounce from this height will bounce more times
than a ball bounce from here.
Now before making this video
I assumed you wanted to throw
as low and parallel to the water as possible
like this,
but actually the ideal throw
looks something more like this.
Here's the guy who holds the world record in rock skipping
throwing from a bridge,
to demonstrate you don't need a super low throw to the water
to have it skip.
The third key is to flick the rock your wrist as much as possible
to get it spinning.
As you know
spinning things are more stable.
This is because they have angular momentum
and resist having it changed
according to Newton's first law.
So spinning and therefore stability is important
because it will maintain that magic
20 degree ramp angle with the water
as you can see here.
If it's not spinning enough it will rotate over
and then sink.
And finally rock choice is important
but not in the way I originally thought.
Primarily, it just needs to be flat on the bottom
to create that ramp.
but shape and diameter don't matter nearly as much.
The heavier the better because you put more energy into the system,
but not so big
that you can't reach the terminal velocity of your arm
by the time you release the rock.
This is especially important for kids.
They'll see much more success with small lightweight rocks.
And I should also mention that we looped back and checked
a couple of papers we discovered about rock skipping
and for the most part it matched
really closely to what we discovered ourselves.
And so armed with our new knowledge,
I put all the nieces and nephews through rock skip boot camp
to get the perfect technique into their muscle memories.
And while it started a bit rough,
they all eventually graduated.
[Music]
And the clay discs tended to be a little more forgiving
so we trained with those first,
and then graduated to actual rocks
and the principles translated perfectly.
And so after a hard workout,
like all true performance athletes,
we carb loaded.
[Music]
So there you have it.
In addition to learning to skip rocks like a pro,
hopefully you picked up some tips on the engineering design process.
People ask me all the time
""I have an egg drop competition coming up. Here are the materials I can use. What's the best solution?""
I don't know.
No one does,
without running some tests.
Because it depends on the actual rules of the competition
or maybe the brand of materials you chose
or how you actually put it together.
So you should do some googling for inspiration
and then make a bunch of prototypes
and do small changes on each to see what matters and what doesn't.
And only then go back and build your final version with some confidence
that you're gonna dominate the competition.
Last time I went to China, I learned two things
first the hearty pancake breakfast is poorly named
and second
I couldn't access Netflix or YouTube
or any of the sites I normally go to
unless I was using NordVPN,
who also just happened to be supporting this video.
If you travel internationally VPN is a must
but it's also important at home too.
As you know VPN stands for virtual private network.
So you could surf the web anonymously,
your location stays private,
and all your data is encrypted.
And even though I'm not a bad guy with something to hide,
I generate a ton of data online every day,
which I would prefer not to be used against me,
like a lot of the news stories you hear lately.
And as a bonus if you ever get a message about content not being available in your country,
hypothetically, with just a click of a mouse
your computer can teleport to anywhere in the world.
It's me, Mario!
And NordVPN is the best
because it's super easy to set up and to use
and super fast with thousands of servers across the globe.
They also have Apple and Android apps for mobile browsing that are free with your account.
So if you travel, or if you're just ready to start taking your privacy more seriously,
you go to NordVPN.com/MarkRober
or use the link of the video description for
77 percent off their three-year plan.
Which works out to less than three bucks a month.
So, it's NordVPN.com/MarkRober
and you promo code MarkRober at checkout
so they know I sent you.
Thanks for watching.

I was challenged to create electricity to support this beast
It's Volkswagens carbon-fiber dual engine
Faster than a Formula one electric supercar
For the upcoming infamous 12 and 1/2 mile Pikes Peak race to the top of a really high mountain in Colorado
And they gave me no further instructions on how they wanted it done
So I thought how cool to be to charge it up using one of those science fair lemon batteries
And since I'm pretty sure using only one lemon isn't going to cut it
My plan is to build the Guinness world record
World's largest lemon battery and when it comes to making ridiculous things no one is better at that than fellow YouTube engineer
William P. Osman. The first video I saw of yours was when you bio hacked your dog. How did that work?
Not well
we tried to dangle a hot dog in front of a dog's face on a
Mechanical backpack and then you can steer the hot dog
To try to get the dog to change directions and what he ended up doing was sitting down and eating him
So we've estimated this should take about three days for us to build and yet I've only allotted
Two minutes for this in the video. So you know what that means you plan on your videos
We didn't want our battery setup to just be a mangled mess of wires
So William had the brilliant idea to waterjet out a bunch of copper and zinc strips, which we can then assemble into racks
Who are the first half of the racks to be in parallel and that was in series with the second half of the racks
Which were also all in parallel and then at that point all we had to do was impale some lemons
Speaking of which in addition to harvesting from my own backyard
I visited some local farms and got their class two lemons
Which means they couldn't be sold in stores because they were either overripe miss shapen or too small
and when one finds oneself in possession of
1232 lemons, turns out you can't not do this
So here we have the world's largest
Lemon battery and now is the moment of truth to see just how much power this could actually make for us
But in order to understand the results, let's first review how a lemon can even make power in the first place
The trick is picking the right metals to stick into the lemon in this case
Zinc really wants to get rid of electrons and then copper really wants to collect them
But they can't do that unless they're connected by some kind of electrolyte and that's the lemon juice
once that happens an electrochemical reaction occurs the bass and the electrons can now move and moving electrons is the very definition of
Electricity it's sort of like how the water up high in the full cup naturally wants to flow to the empty cup lower down
But it can't do that until you connect the two with the straw which allows the water to flow
So in this case, obviously the higher cup is the zinc
The lower cup is the copper and the straw is the lemon and so then the flowing water
represents our electricity or power and so with that we were measuring just under five volts and the short-circuit current is
Not great, Mark. Basically, our lemon battery is awful. Yeah like it's impressive
No, the fact that it works as well as it does is cool. But as well as it works is not
Well, does that make any sense? It makes no sense whatever you just said
And to quantify the suckiness better you can listen to a motor running off our 1,200 lemons
Versus a single double-a battery
So what was looking good for the car
But we weren't about to let three days of work go down the drain
So because the battery produces so little power we use a tiny tiny
High gear ratio motor fifteen hundred to one to charge up our potential energy
Which is more lemon so it should take about 15 minutes to lift this bag and then we can release that all at once
to activate our lemon juicing mechanism, basically
Like all of these guys are working together to like drain the lifeblood from one of their brethren. Maybe this is too dark
Okay, William moment of truth. I am so excited. Give me some of that. Cheers. Cheers
Wow refreshing
organic not worth
10 hours amazing 12 hours totally worth it
This is the most expensive glass of lemonade you will ever have. Yes, that actually is a fact. It's a win in my book
I'm gonna finish this. I'm not
So we let the lemons trickle charge for a couple days
And after that the total power we harvested for the Volkswagen
Racing team was the equivalent of a single double-a battery and I should mention that since the race team is busy getting the car ready
For the race in Colorado. They have sent me this monstrous 48 kilowatt hour battery that can drive itself
So the plan is I will add any power we generate here in
California to this battery and then get this to them in time for the race in, Colorado
So the measly lemon power is now inside, but clearly I need to think of a plan B
Luckily I had an idea
Which is to take some pulleys and a skateboard wheel and a brushless motor then some custom machined aluminum plates and a steel
Cable to make a zipline with regenerative braking to charge a drill battery
And it seems to actually be working. All I needed now was a party with some family friends and their kids
This is how much energy is in the battery. We need to get it from empty all the way up to the full
That's where I need you guys because what happens is as you go down on this zipline
It charges the battery
The worst part about a zipline is when you have to go down and then drag it back up the hill
But I've got a little remote control here watch this
Is that cool? You guys want to ride that? you ready?
Mechanical advantage of the sloped Hill disguises it well
But the amount of energy they are adding to our zipline system here by running up the hill just one time is the same energy
used for the world record dead lift
And to provide power to their leg muscles
we repurposed our lemon battery lemons into fresh lemonade and
Everyone had to take a drink before running up the hill because as they say when life gives you 1200 lemons make lemonade
Then force kids to drink it to power your regenerative zipline
So the zipline was awesome
And we ended up charging up one of these portable drill batteries plus a little more. Now for those of you keeping track at home
Here's how I'm doing so far
the limits have enough power to move the
supercar about this far on a soccer field and then with the lemonade and the kids muscles in the zipline it can now travel an
additional two soccer fields
The problem is the race is 200 soccer fields long, which means if we were to try and charge the car
We'd be 198 soccer fields short. So clearly that kind of power will not be breaking any records
So I've got to come up with a plan C and to do that
I'm gonna harness the power of the Sun and in hindsight
I probably should have started here because if you think about it all the energy sources we use are actually
solar powered. Oil and coal and natural gas
It's just old decayed plants and swamps that originally got their power from the Sun using their leaves and photosynthesis
Even things like wind turbines are really solar powered because the wind blows when the Sun heats up the atmosphere
unevenly in the case of
hydroelectric dams the water got to the lake on the high side because of rain from the clouds and clouds a result of water that
Has been evaporated by you guessed it, the Sun. As humans
We are even solar power because we get our energy from plants or animals that ate plants
Which again get their power from the Sun
so if I was looking for some energy to fill up a battery instead of indirectly and
Inefficiently going through a bunch of different energy sources and losing a bunch at every step along the way
it makes way more sense to just go directly to the source
And so with that in mind I busted out the power tools and put twenty-four 100 watt solar panels over our garage
But there was a problem with this. When NASA sent the solar power twin Rovers to Mars in 2004
It didn't take long until the solar panels were
Totally covered in dust which effectively crippled the rover because they couldn't get as much energy from the Sun and this was a huge issue
But then we got lucky and a mini tornado came by and cleaned them off restoring the power
It turns out these mini tornadoes are actually pretty common on Mars which is why she is still driving around today
Nearly more than 14 years later. This is also in part why on the next Rover we sent to Mars
We just killed the issue altogether and slapped a nuclear reactor on the back and while California isn't Mars
It does get pretty dusty here. So to ensure that wouldn't happen to me
I invited over some really smart future engineers scientists and creators
and after explaining the problem and
demonstrating how severely it limits the power output from the panel's I challenged them to come up with and build a solution
And because our brains use up 20% of all the energy our body produces. I made them drink more lemonade to ensure
I got an optimal solution and so after pitching each other their ideas, they settled on one and got to work
Personally I thought it was brilliant and it worked extremely well and after they left I hooked it up to my lawn sprinkler system
So they go off for a few minutes once a week now and so after a few days of being bombarded by photons from space
We finally had the battery all charged up to full capacity
So in the end I learned a lot and we actually pulled it off
And now if you'll excuse me, I have an urgent delivery deadline to meet in Colorado
i like lemonade
Okay, you like it Eliza? Okay"

a few weeks ago
I lost my wallet which made me sad because it is a pain to get everything replaced
Then I thought, what kind of person doesn't return a wallet
And then I thought I'm a firm believer in the scientific method,
I should test some hypothoses.
So I got 200 identical wallets in order to drop them in each of the 20 cities you see here the goal being not
Only to see which cities were the most and least honest, but to ask
questions of anyone who called in to see if I could pick out some patterns among the honest ones and I wanted to make the
Wallets look as real as possible so in each of them
I put a fake ID with no picture so as not to bias people six American dollars and 200 Filipino dollars
This is a way to make it look like a lot of money when in reality this is only worth 4 bucks
Then I put in an ultrasound picture and on the back we hand wrote a date from four years ago
And then this adorable picture of a puppy I found on reddit. The goal was in addition to the ID and the money I wanted
To make a look like the wallet had sentimental value to the owner.
I was trying to remove any excuse for someone not to return the wallet such as it looked fake
Or it wouldn't be worth hassle
If there was only 2 bucks inside of a blank wallet. So in our case if they didn't return it
It would only be because they weren't being honest. Then we had a fake loyalty card and a random business card
And then critically a card that looked like he came with the wallet
That said if found please call and then we wrote the phone number.
And then because it's impractical for me to actually visit 20 cities
I went on the Instagram page from a YouTube channel to ask for help and right away the response was awesome. Once I'd selected my
20 helpers I sent them instructions and shipped them each 10 wallets and then last Monday all across, North America
operation wallet drop commenced.
(music)
I asked them after they dropped the wallets to try and get some secret footage if
Possible and to do that they came up with some pretty clever methods.
I'm actually gonna tuck the wallet underneath my car so I Drive away it stays in the parking lot
Almost immediately calls started pouring in from all of the cities so when people call in we ask them eight
Questions such as if they were religious or not or if there was still money in the wallet when they found it and if so
Of course we told them just keep it. So after three days of collecting data:
Here's what we found for starters and this blew my mind two-thirds of the wallets were returned and of those that were returned
96 percent still had the money inside. The average age of one of the caller's was
36 which is almost exactly the average age of a person in the U.S.
So how old you are it doesn't seem to affect honesty.
There's a pretty big disparity in which cities were the most and least honest
and I'll get to the rankings in just a minute.
But first I wanted to test a
hypothesis that a person without a lot of money in considered poor would be less likely to return the wallet than someone who had a
lot of money. And to do this I looked at publicly available census data and found the zip codes with the highest and lowest
medium income then I instructed my friends helping in each city to randomly drop half the wallets in the high-income area of the city and
then the other half in the low-income area. In each while it was marked with a unique number on the back of this card
so we knew exactly which city and location if somebody called it in. And when we tallied it up:
60 wallets were called in from the high-income areas and
exactly 60 wallets were also returned from the low-income areas which I thought was pretty cool. So a rich person is no more likely to return
A wallet than someone in the lowest income bracket who could probably use the money.
In fact: we had one person calling who is homeless, two people calling who are living in shelters, and a fourth person who is a
panhandler. All four of them had full wallets. Another question
I wanted a test was if women were more honest than men it turns out a majority of the wallets were returned by men but
Think about it that doesn't necessarily mean. They are more honest because maybe the locations they were dropped
There's typically more men like in front of a sports bar or a hardware store so to control for this
I had all my helping friends in each city dropped two of the ten wallets in a men's restroom
And then two in a women's bathroom
This way we could control the gender of the wallet finder once again this came up nearly identical
with 23 wallets returned for men versus
24 for women so gender doesn't seem to play a role in a person's honesty either
And I should mention here one of the questions
We asked the caller's was if they thought the wallet looked fake
or
Suspicious at all and only a very small minority did so this confirms that for those who didn't call it was likely because they were
Dishonest and not because they thought it wasn't a real person's wallet another thing we tested was small town versus big city
So you notice four of the cities you've probably never heard of before that's because they have populations of around a thousand people
whereas the rest were the largest cities in North America and here we did see a
Significant difference in the small towns the average rate of return was eight wallets whereas in the big cities
It was six
And I think this sort of makes sense to me because small towns tend to foster a sense of community
Where everyone knows everyone versus the anonymity of a big city and now for a rundown of all the cities?
I'll break them into three categories starting with the least honest
We've got Detroit with three wallets returned and New York City with four I was really rooting for Detroit and hoping they would just surprise
Everyone but looks like maybe they're still in the process of their rebuilding efforts then for the middle of the pack at five wallets return
We've got Seattle, Los Angeles Miami Dallas and Edmonton and at six well. It's return
We've got Huntsville, Alabama and New London Connecticut, which is one of our small towns next at seven wallets
We've got San Francisco, Winnipeg and Washington DC
The final category is the Honest Abe cities with Parma, Idaho and Las Vegas at eight wallets
And I should mention for Vegas instead of high-income and low-income we put half on the strip and then half in the suburbs and for
What it's worth all five dropped on the strip were returned and then at a remarkable nine wallets return
We've got two more small cities with Nashua, Idaho and Hill City, South Dakota and then Portland
Oregon Macon Fred and Carrie proud and finally there were two cities with an astounding
100% return rate vote for big cities with Chicago which I didn't see coming
And then Salt Lake City and before he just shot, Salt Lake City up to those gosh darn super nice Mormons
It's like of the eight people wearable the interview only three said they were religious and only one
Attended church in fact about 40% of the people who turn in wallet said they were not religious
And this is close enough to the average for a large city that
it's fair to say that whether or not a person was religious seem to have no outcome on their honesty according to our data and
I should also mention that while our two Canadian cities finished right in the middle of the pack my Canadian friend saw this on his
Facebook page right after dropping his wallets and going the extra mile with a
Blanket Facebook post to find a random wallet owner is just about the most Canadian thing ever
He also dropped ten wallets in Disneyland, and we were hoping to get a large number back
But we only got four calls from individuals
and then too from
Security who were super confused when they had identical wallets turned in at which point they made it very clear
They would not be calling us back if more wallets came in because they hate science so we had a third Disney Line now as
A data point because we just don't know how many got turned into security
So those were the findings
And I'd say from all this I learned two things
The first is that it's a really good idea to put your phone number somewhere in your wall
That's probably one of the reasons we have such a high rate of return also
I found out if you find a wallet you can drop it in any u.s.
Post office box, and then we return it to the address found on the driver's license free of charge
I tested this out and it totally works and the second thing is that in general
People are way more honest than I originally thought having just lost my wallet
I was anticipating a return rate of maybe 20%
so to get two out of every three wallets back blew my mind in one city a
Convenience order loved what we were doing so she kept putting the wallet back in the bathroom received someone would steal it and after six
Times of somebody bringing the wallet back with all of the money inside she gave up trying
Lately it seems like so much of what you see online is meant to stoke
Outrage at some group of people versus ourselves because that's what gets shared and that begins to warp our
Perspectives that the only good people out there are those within our own group
but this cold hard data shows that across any age or gender or
socio-economic background
cross the whole religious spectrum through middle of
America and along the coast there are lots of good people everywhere and not only that but they constitute a majority
these people didn't call it for some reward or
Facebook lights or because they knew someone was watching they did it because it was simply the right thing to do and I think that's
Pretty cool and something worth remembering

This is a mousetrap car.
They're common for competitions in high school physics classes
Just like the egg drop challenge or building toothpick bridges. The goal is to build a car that travels the furthest or goes the
Fastest, but in either case the only power provided to move the car is from a single
mousetrap. So today
I'm going to show you how to win first place by building some cars with the
World-record holder. Then we're gonna go to the West Coast Championships to see all these principles in action, and wait don't leave! I know that
99.7% of you have never, nor will ever make one of these,
but I will break down in simple terms
how I know this car will go twice as far as this one,
and then I'll prove it. And then we'll discuss why you see these
DVD wheels so often, but do they work? And why do some winning cars have wheels that look like this?
But before we fly all the way out the Texas to meet the world record holder,
I need to lay the foundation for the one overarching
fundamental physics principle behind the mousetrap car.
It's called mechanical advantage and to do that
I'm gonna need my niece and nephews. ""Imma bet you guys I could lift my car off the ground
using just my pinkies. If I can't do it, you can have this crisp Benjamin
but if I can, you guys have to buy me ice cream. Deal?""
""I said nothing else but your Pinky!""
""I am using just my pinkies. ""No just your pinkies."" ""That's what I'm doing!""
""This is really good you guys. Thank you.""
If you're willing to move a greater distance.
You're able to reduce the amount of force and by a proportional amount.
I can't lift 500 pounds worth of car one time.
But I could lift 10 pounds 50 times. A mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output force over the input force.
So in this case it's 50. That means my hand had to travel 50 times further than just lifting the car in one shot.
But the weight was 50 times less, so it was totally worth it. This principle of mechanical advantage is everywhere.
Let's take a look at a few examples.
If I have 4 pulleys that means I have to pull the rope down 4 times further than the dumbbell goes up.
But in exchange, it feels four times lighter, so this has a mechanical advantage of 4. For the ramp
you look at the ratio of the length to the height. Your mechanical advantage therefore is 2.2. And that means
I have to travel a little further,
But the brick should feel 2.2 times lighter
pulling up the ramp versus just pulling the brick straight up. And sure enough if you measure each with a scale
This is exactly what you see. If you think about it a screw is just a ramp
wrapped around a nail. So here
you look at this has traveled around the thread and divided by the space in between the threads to get a mechanical advantage of 9
And as you know if you really want to multiply your force use a ratchet wrench
Now that is since your hand travels for one full rotation is 300 times longer
than the distance the screw moves vertically between one thread the total mechanical advantage is 300
It's like a really long short ramp
So if this scale reads 6 pounds the actual clamping force would be
300 times more or nearly a ton
And with wheels and axles it's the same story since this wheel diameter is twice what this one is as you could probably guess by
now this weight weighs twice as much so now we're balanced with a mechanical advantage of 2
And you'll also notice if I move this, the lesser weight travels twice as far and finally we have levers
Which is where we started with my niece and nephews, here if you compare the ratio of the distances from the pivot point we have
A mechanical advantage of 4 which of course means I have to move this end four times further
But it's super easy because it's 1/4 the weight on this side, and in all of these examples
Which you see everywhere around us you trade lower force for more distance travelled
This is how humans built amazing things before all these fancy machines with engines came around
Human muscles are totally strong enough as long as you're willing to spend a little more distance to do the task, and so this principle
Mechanical advantage is at play over and over again with the mousetrap cars only in reverse. It works both ways in other words
I don't want the full force of the spring acting over this tiny distance to act directly on the wheels or they would spin out
That would be a very inefficient
Transfer of energy from the spring, so we use
mechanical advantage and make the main lever arm 15 times longer than the spring lever arm, and then the wheel diameter is
24 times bigger than the wheel axle so then if we multiply them our total mechanical advantage is 1 over
360. That means the force is 360 times less right here on the output at the wheels to the floor
Versus right here on the input on the spring. It also means it will travel
360 times further than the distance this spring arm rotates
alright, so that's enough of a foundation for now let's go to Texas and meet up with my buddy Al, to build some racecars
Not only is he the mousetrap car world record holder,
but he also kind of started the whole thing, and
he was Texas high school physics teacher of the year, and since my dream job is to one day switch from working as an engineer
In the private sector, to go teach high school physics somewhere. I made him show me all his cool demos.
I came up with this idea back in
1991 and since that time I have literally built
thousands and thousands of mousetrap cars myself
I've seen every possible engineering design you could ever come up with
There's lots of different variations for rules for a mousetrap car race. Let's talk about how to build the best
Long-distance car first for our testing we started with three identical cars the only difference was the length of the lever arm
So one was short one was medium, and one was long, and I've calculated each of their mechanical advantages
Which you can see written here and given what we know about mechanical advantage. What do you think is about to happen?
As you might have guessed the short lever arm car takes a strong early lead this makes sense because it has the largest
mechanical advantage therefore the highest force
Where the wheels and ground meet the downside is that it's a short-lived burst and the medium and long lever arm cars pass it once?
It's quickly used up all its energy
